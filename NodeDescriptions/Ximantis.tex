\pbox{19cm}{\Tstrut 
\ximantis is a Swedish traffic forecasting company founded in 2014 and is part of the Lund University Innovation System. \ximantis produces forecasts of upcoming traffic congestion in real time thus allowing users to avoid them. The forecasting capabilities of \ximantis have been repeatedly tested and validated on different occasions in real traffic with data provided by the Federal Traffic Safety Administration of the USA. It has been shown to be capable to produce detailed traffic evolution and congestion information at specific, chosen, road locations and specific future times. This capability allows for significant savings in time and energy resources. Given the huge impact of traffic in $CO_2$ emissions and other harmful particulates as well as the waste of precious energy recourses due to congestion the environmental benefits proposed by the \ximantis forecasting provide clear incentives for this technology.

\begin{enumerate}%[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-2pt,leftmargin=*]
\item Dr. Alexandros Sopasakis,
% received his Bachelors (1992), Masters (1996) and PhD (2000) in Mathematics from Texas A\&M University. He subsequently held a postdoc position at Chalmers (2000-2001) funded under a mobility program from EU and academic positions in mathematical research at Georgia Tech, Berkeley, New York University and University of Massachusetts. From 2007-2011 he held a tenure track position at the University North Carolina and   
since 2011 a tenured position at Lund University where he also received his Lecturer qualification. A. Sopasakis received Two National Science Foundation grants as main PI and several grants in the USA and Sweden as co-researcher. 
%Because of his diversification in research Dr. Sopasakis has been able to work in many areas including descriptions of micromagnetic behavior, planetary weather prediction, multiscale particle interactions and traffic flow evolution. 
He is the CEO and Founder of \ximantis. Commitment: 10\%
