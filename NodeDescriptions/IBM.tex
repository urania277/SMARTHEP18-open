IBM France is the French subsidiary of IBM, a hardware, software and
services company based in Armonk, New York, United States. IBM France
has founded IBM France Lab in 2011, after having acquired ILOG. IBM
France Lab gathers all the R\&D entities based in France as a result
of several mergers and acquisitions (in particular ILOG, Rational,
SPSS). IBM France Lab develops software products in the domain of
Cognitive Computing, namely Decision Engineering.

\item[Dr.~Hugues~Juille'] is a software engineer in the
  Prescriptive Analytics \& Decision Optimization Team. He works on the
  design and development of tools for modelling optimization
  problems. He also conducts research on algorithms taking advantage
  of OR algorithms for improving ML performance. \textbf{Role:} main
  supervisor of ESR13, commitment: 15\%.
\item[Paul Shaw] is a research scientist and leader in
  constraint programming working in the Decision Optimization team.
  His background is in constraint programming, optimization modelling,
  and local search.  He works on the CP Optimizer solver and the use
  of optimization tools in machine learning, commitment: 10\%.

IBM France Lab is located in three principal premises in France:
Gentilly, Nice and Pornichet. These three sites have been declared
strategic at a worldwide level by the relevant Business Lines. IBM
France Lab conducts its technological activity thanks to the
contribution of highly-skilled scientists and developers. In
particular, the staff comprises 100+ PhD, several Distinguished
Engineers and Senior Technical Staff Members.

Since the creation of the Center for Advanced Studies in 2010, IBM
France has hired 11 PhD students from major Engineering Schools in
France (4 have defended in 2017), and participated in several academic
projects, including with Ecole Polytechnique and Université Claude
Bernard. Moreover, IBM France has contributed in several collaborative
Research projects, e.g. Ontorule (2009-2012), Matrics (2014-2016)
Ideas (2012-2015) and, in association with IBM Italy MINO (2012–2016),
for EU projects. Rider (2010-2014), and OptimodLyon (2012-2014) are
examples of French-subsidized research projects performed by IBM
France. \\
IBM France Lab currently hosts 2 PhD students, and is in the process
of recruiting 4 more in the coming months, including one in the
framework of ITN MINOA, in which IBM France is a beneficiary. Members
of IBM France Lab teach in universities and major Engineering schools,
and the Lab plans to host a number of Master internship starting in Q2
2018. In addiiton, IBM France Lab contributes in the AFIA academic
association, and organizes 4 scientific conferences each year, namely
“Les Vendredi du CAS” that gather together researchers from inside and
outside IBM.
