IBM France is the French subsidiary of IBM, a hardware, software and services company based in Armonk, New York, United States. 
IBM France has founded IBM France Lab in 2011, after having acquired ILOG. IBM France Lab gathers all the R\&D entities based in France as a result of several mergers and acquisitions (in particular ILOG, Rational, SPSS). IBM France Lab develops software products in the domain of Cognitive Computing, namely Decision Engineering. 
IBM France Lab is the software and hardware development organization inside IBM France, that specializes in particular in the development of software products in the domains of decision systems and DevOps. IBM France Lab covers a large spectrum of in-depth expertise especially in the realms of Operational Research, Constraint Programming, Mathematical Optimization and Rule-based Reasoning. IBM Is amongst the world leaders in commercial-grade technology in these domains.
In addition to its own computing facilities, IBM France Lab can draw on IBM cloud pods and HPC facilities located in France and in Europe for its research purposes.
IBM France has a startup accelerator program, named Scalezone and located in its headquarters in Bois-Colombes, near Paris, France.
The French Center for Advanced Studies (CAS) is the research department inside IBM France Lab, which coordinates the industrial Research activity of the 600+ employees of France Lab, with a focus on collaborative R\&D activities (scientific cooperations, PhD theses, European and national R\&D projects?).
To extend its research presence in France and especially with regards to Artificial Intelligence, IBM France is opening a new co-innovation center in Orsay, on the academic and industrial research Campus Paris-Saclay. The new co-innovation center will focus on the next wave of AI, combining symbolic AI (e.g. knowledge-based systems) and numeric AI (e.g. data-based machine learning technology such as deep learning). As part of this program, IBM France CAS is currently training and hiring PhD students on related subjects, such as to combining probabilistic data (such as the output of predictive models) and rule-based systems, explanations in recommender systems, detecting data unfit for a deep learning model (such as malicious attacks), or using machine learning to improve the performance of constraint-based optimisation. PhD theses defended by students trained in IBM France recently include research on explaining rule-based decisions or adjusting decision rules automatically in an evolving environment.
The participation of IBM France in the SMARTHEP project is an integral part of this research programme.

%Since the creation of the Center for Advanced Studies in 2010, IBM
%France has hired 11 PhD students from major Engineering Schools in
%France (4 have defended in 2017), and participated in several academic
%projects, including with Ecole Polytechnique and Universite Claude
%Bernard. Moreover, IBM France has contributed in several collaborative
%Research projects, e.g. Ontorule (2009-2012), Matrics (2014-2016)
%Ideas (2012-2015) and, in association with IBM Italy MINO (2012-Äì2016),
