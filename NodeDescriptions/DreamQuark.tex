\dqlong is a startup founded by a particle physicist in order
to help insurance companies and healthcare professionals take
advantage of the recent developments in machine learning and big-data
techniques. % Nicolas MERIC, its founder has realized that the right
% combination of skills in physics, machine learning and efficient
% programming for big-data analysis could be unvaluable for these
% communities. Particle physicists have all the skills necessary to
% conduct efficient Big-Data analyses. Nevertheless, they are not so
% often creating companies and generally leave particle physics
% generally to move to finance, insurance or general IT. 
%
% DreamQuark is therefore quite an exception and could be inspiring for
% particle physicists. Its founder has already given talks in particle
% physics related conferences and could further spread the
% message. Similar initiatives could be largely developed with this
% present program which would help drive the Big-Data economy with
% initiatives in logistics, detection devices, healthcare,
% fintech\dots. Insurance companies and healthcare professionals are for
% example eager to work with expert and motivated professionals that can
% help them efficiently tackle their most complicated
% challenges. Big-Data is their current challenge and only few expert
% big-data professionals are on the market. The current experience of
% Nicolas MERIC is that being seen as a particle physicist definitely
% gives credit to our message.
% 
%In brief, 
\dqlong maintains a platform to help these companies 
%to help insurance companies and healthcare professionals 
to develop the next generation tools in
prevention, diagnosis and care systems. \dqlong uses deep-learning
to help these professionals to have a better understanding of their data
and to develop more accurate tools. \dqlong has partnered with several
insurance companies and laboratories to develop innovative
applications in prevention and diagnosis. \dqlong is currently developing,
as an example, with a laboratory an auto-diagnosis system that can help
a diagnosis apparatus to detect  why a
result is incorrect,if a measurement is correct, and to auto-correct the measure such as a
technician would do. This experiment opens the roads to self assessed
robots or failure conscious systems that can auto-repair themselves,
warn their users or send the proper instructions to a technician for
quick interventions. % Another prevention system has been developed for
% an insurer and has been showcased at a major innovation event in
% December.

\item Software to measure the impact of office, healthcare, and work
  organization management scenarios on employees quality of life. This
  software is intended to help an insurance company propose a new
  service. This software helps companies understand why their
  employees are absent at work and therefore act on the causes to
  reduce their amount of absent employees. 
%
% We used our technologies and particle physicists approaches to build
% the prediction engine. With our approach, it is not possible to use
% the software to predict if a single employee will be absent. Rather we
% propose an aggregated view of the situation to act on it globally
% through targeted action plans.  
%
\item Laboratory robot control software which learns from failed
  measurements and adapts behavior for future. This software is
  intended to help the medical diagnosis industry improve their
  products and reduce the failure rate of their measurement. 
% It is
%   today difficult and time consuming for a single technician to
%   identify why a measurement has been corrupted. Our technology can
%   work with several hundred variables all at once. It is therefore
%   more efficient to use it in order to help the robot decide what
%   action has to be taken in order to reach a correct measurement. 
We
  learn from the recorded data the relations between the failures and
  the different variable measurements in order to quickly identify the
  reason behind a failure. The engine can then act on the robot in
  order to perform the same action as a technician would have done.
