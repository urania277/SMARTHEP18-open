\pbox{8cm}{\Tstrut General\\Description\Bstrut} & %
\pbox{19cm}{\Tstrut  \unigelong (\unigeshort) is Switzerland's second largest university with more than 17\,000 students of 150 different nationalities and more than 3950 researchers of 113 nationalities, who study and work in 9 different faculties. 
The university provides an international environment for education and research. It has long history of strong ties with international research organisations, such as \cern. 
As a result of its history and its strategic choices, the \unigeshort made possible a diversity of research areas to emerge in which the institution excels. 
High energy physics, profiting strongly from the geographical vicinity to CERN, is one such area of excellence.

\begin{enumerate}%[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-2pt,leftmargin=*]
\item Prof.~Anna Sfyrla, physics, assistant professor, experimental particle physics and a member of the ATLAS collaboration. 
She had various responsibility positions at ATLAS in areas spanning the trigger, searches for new physics  and the HL-LHC upgrade. 
She is currently the thesis director of 2 PhD students, and supervises a post-doctoral researcher. 
She has supervised many PhD, master and summer students in trigger and analysis projects. 
She has organised, hosted and convened numerous workshops related to her areas of research. 
More details: \url{http://dpnc.unige.ch/~sfyrla/}. 
Role: supervisor of \ESRb, responsible for WP2. 
Commitment: 20\%. 
\item Dr.~Steven Schramm, physics, senior postdoc, member of the ATLAS Collaboration. 
 He has previously or currently holds positions in areas relating to the trigger, machine learning, and the reconstruction of physics objects used for dark matter searches: ATLAS jet trigger coordinator (2015-2017), convener of ATLAS jet substructure group (2017-present), founder and coordinator of LHC Inter-experimental Machine Learning group (2015-2018). 
 Scientific secretary to the ATLAS trigger and data acquisition steering group (2017-present). 
 Recipient of Canadian Banting fellowship. Expertise in jet reconstruction, searches for new physics, machine learning, data analysis, triggering. 
 He has previously and continues to co-supervise many PhD, MSc, and summer students in the areas of triggers, jet performance, and analysis.   
 Role: additional supervisor of ESR2, tutoring of students seconded at CERN. Commitment: 20\%.

\pbox{19cm}{\Tstrut  
The Department of Nuclear and Particle Physics of the \unigelong studies the fundamental structures and laws of nature following three complementary directions: collider physics at \cern s LHC; neutrino physics in collider experiments; astroparticle physics experiments on the group and in space. 
The ATLAS group of the department has made significant contributions to the construction and operation of the experiment. 
It is presently contributing to event reconstruction and searches for new physics, as well as the HL-LHC upgrade.
\unigeshort has computing clusters available for the ATLAS affiliated students and researchers, comprised of more than 3000 computing cores. 
The ATLAS group owns several hundreds of TB of disk storage space, as well as high-performance GPUs obtained recently to further the research and development of machine learning tools and real-time applications. 
Many internal training programmes and facilities are available to the ESR affiliated to \unigeshort. 
The student will have access to the universities Doctoral School, where experimental and theoretical aspects of High Energy Physics at PhD level are taught. 
The student will also have access to career forums organised by the University of Geneva.
