\pbox{19cm}{\Tstrut 
\cern is an International European Organization and is the worlds largest particle physics centre, providing technologically-advanced facilities for particle physics. 
CERN has 22 member states. 
Close to 13,000 scientists from 650 institutes worldwide are involved in the research and technology programme. 
CERN's mission is focused on 4 topics: research, technology, collaboration and education, including a long and strong training tradition via the Fellows, Associates and Students programmes. 
It has its own Learning and Development service providing almost 14,000 person days of technical management, communication, academic, safety and language training per year. 
The Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most powerful human-made particle collider, is located at CERN, together with its four main experiments: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. 
Researchers from all four collaborations, who spearheaded real-time analysis in their own experiments, are involved in \acronym.  
CERN hosts the largest particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which generates data rates of over 100~Exabytes per year.  
CERN's aims include education and it offers a number of educational and training  programmes to students and teachers, as well as playing a leading role in the International Masterclass programme.
