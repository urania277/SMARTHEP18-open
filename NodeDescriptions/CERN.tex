\pbox{19cm}{\Tstrut 
\cern is an International European Organization and is the worlds largest particle physics centre, providing technologically-advanced facilities for particle physics. 
CERN has 22 member states. 
Close to 13,000 scientists from 650 institutes worldwide are involved in the research and technology programme. 
CERN's mission is focused on 4 topics: research, technology, collaboration and education, including a long and strong training tradition via the Fellows, Associates and Students programmes. 
It has its own Learning and Development service providing almost 14,000 person days of technical management, communication, academic, safety and language training per year. 
The Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most powerful human-made particle collider, is located at CERN, together with its four main experiments: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. 
Researchers from all four collaborations, who spearheaded real-time analysis in their own experiments, are involved in \acronym.  
CERN hosts the largest particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which generates data rates of over 100~Exabytes per year.  
CERN's aims include education and it offers a number of educational and training  programmes to students and teachers, as well as playing a leading role in the International Masterclass programme.

Due to its position as a focal point for research into elementary particle physics and associated technologies, CERN has state-of-the-art technological infrastructure and equipment. 
This spans a very large range of facilities such as accelerators and particle detectors, a forefront informatics backbone including Grid developments, state-of-the-art laboratories for mechanical, electronic, microelectronic and optoelectronic engineering and large cryogenics installations.
In addition to standard office space with fibre-optic network connectivity and a library with access to over 2000 journals relevant to HEP and DS, CERN provides extensive support and infrastructure for both data analysis and computing.
This includes a 100 node computing cluster and 2~Tb of disk space for each researcher's own work.
In addition ESRs will have access to a dedicated cluster of around 10 nodes composed of the latest available GPU processors, and a second dedicated cluster of around 10 nodes composed of the latest available CPU processors.} \tabularnewline\hline
