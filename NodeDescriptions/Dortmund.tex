\pbox{19cm}{\Tstrut TU Dortmund University is hosting more than 34,000 students. 
It has developed a unique profile with particular research strength in natural and engineering sciences, focusing in interdisciplinary and innovative synergies in research. 
The department of Physics has about 50 lecturers and post-doctoral researchers and about 150 PhD students. 
Research focuses are particle physics, solid state physics, and accelerator physics. 
The attractive study program of the department has led to an enormous increase in undergraduate students with currently more than 1,200.
%
The group "Experimentelle Physik" covers a large area of research in particle physics, focused on data analysis and detector development. 
The group is a member of the LHCb collaboration since 2003 and is central to the development of the High Level Trigger of the experiment and was leading the efforts towards the upgrade trigger Technical Design Report. 
In addition, the group is significantly contributing to the upgraded tracking detector (SciFi-tracker). 
The group is also strongly involved in the core physics analyses of the LHCb experiment. 
Recently, the group intensified its collaboration with the local computer science department by joining the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 "��Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis". 
The Initial Training Network proposal fits extremely well with the group's existing research profile on advanced data analysis techniques

\pbox{19cm}{\Tstrut The department of physics is involved in data analysis at the CERN based experiments LHCb and ATLAS, in neutrino experiments (Magic, Ice Cube, Cobra) and also has a strong particle physics theory department. 
Students benefit from the close link to the theory part of the department and from the intense collaboration between the department of physics and the department of computer science, which is also formalised in the
participation of two research groups in the Collaborative Research Center (SFB 876). 
The group has access to excellent computing resources, including a local computing cluster and are eligible to perform distributed analysis on the Grid. } \tabularnewline\hline

The TU Dortmund currently co-ordinates or participates in 36 EU-projects, amongst them 3 Marie-Curie ITNs. 
The group experimental physics 5 participates in the special research area "��Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis"�� (SFB876), which ideally complements the proposed ITN. 
Its bi-yearly graduate schools are also open to the members of the ITN. 
The department has an extensive programme on graduate and post-graduate courses. 
Additionally, the local ESRs will become members of the \textbf{Research Academy Ruhr}, one of the largest and most powerful platforms in Germany to support young researchers and prepare them for careers inside and outside academia at the University alliance of three UA Ruhr Universities: Bochum, Duisburg-Essen and TU Dortmund.
