TU Dortmund University was founded in 1968 and has 16 faculties
ranging from natural science and 
engineering to social sciences and humanities. The university
currently counts over 34,000 students and about 4,000 of those being
international. TU Dortmund has been ranked among the world's top 50 in
Nature Index's 2018 list of "Rising Stars" mainly due to the number of
articles from physical sciences. The   
department of Physics counts about 50 lecturers and post-doctoral
researchers and about 150 PhD students. 
Research focuses are particle physics, solid state physics, and accelerator physics. 
%The attractive study program of the department has led to an enormous increase in undergraduate students with currently more than 1,200.
The group experimental physics 5 covers a large area of research in particle physics, focused on data analysis and detector development. 
The group is a member of the LHCb collaboration since 2004 and is central to the development of the High Level Trigger of the experiment and was leading the efforts towards the upgrade trigger Technical Design Report. 
In addition, the group is significantly contributing to the upgraded
tracking detector (SciFi-tracker) and core physics of LHCb. 
%The group is also strongly involved in the core physics analyses of the LHCb experiment. 
The group intensely collaborates with the local computer science
department in the frame of the Collaborative Research Center CRC876
"Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis" and the
recently founded Dortmund Data Science Center.

%The Initial Training Network proposal fits extremely well with the group's existing research profile on advanced data analysis techniques.

The department of physics is involved in data analysis at the CERN based experiments LHCb and ATLAS, in neutrino experiments (Magic, Ice Cube, Cobra) and also has a strong particle physics theory department. 
ESRs benefit from the close link to the theory part of the department and from the intense collaboration between the department of physics and the department of computer science, which is also formalised in the
participation of two research groups in the Collaborative Research Center (CRC876). 
The group has access to excellent computing resources, including a
local computing cluster and are eligible to perform distributed
analyses on the Grid.

The TU Dortmund is involved in or coordinating several national and
international graduate schools and training programs including five
MSCA-ITNs one of them in coordinating function. The group
experimental physics 5 participates in the  Collaborative Research
Center  (CRC876), which ideally complements the proposed ITN. Its
integrated bi-yearly graduate schools are open to the members of the
ITN. The department has an extensive programme on graduate and
post-graduate courses. Additionally, the local ESRs will benefit from
the services of the Graduate Center of TU Dortmund and of the Research
Academy Ruhr, one of the largest and most powerful platforms in
Germany, supported by the three University Alliance Ruhr universities
of Bochum, Dortmund, and Duisburg-Essen, with the goal to support
young researchers and prepare them for careers inside and outside
academia. 
The TU Dortmund currently co-ordinates or participates in 36 EU-projects, amongst them 3 Marie-Curie ITNs. 
The group experimental physics 5 participates in the special research area \textit{Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis} (SFB876), which ideally complements the proposed ITN. 
Its bi-yearly graduate schools are also open to the members of the ITN. 
The department has an extensive programme on graduate and post-graduate courses. 
Additionally, the local ESRs will become members of the
\textbf{Research Academy Ruhr}, one of the largest and most powerful
platforms in Germany to support young researchers and prepare them for
careers inside and outside academia at the University alliance of
three UA Ruhr Universities: Bochum, Duisburg-Essen and TU Dortmund.
