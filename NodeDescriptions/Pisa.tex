 INFN is a research, non-profit, government organisation with about 1500 researchers in 20 research structures spread over the Italy and 5 national laboratories. INFN conducts theoretical and experimental research in sub-nuclear, nuclear and astro-particle physics within a framework of international competition and in close collaboration with Italian universities.

\begin{enumerate}%[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-2pt,leftmargin=*]
\item Dr. Alberto Annovi is a staff researcher at INFN Pisa, and a member of the ATLAS collaboration, where his main research interests are in tracking and trigger systems. He is coordinating the Hardware Tracking system for the ATLAS upgrade, and has been the project leader of the ATLAS Fast-Tracker upgrade. He is also a member of the CDF collaboration, where his main research interests have been in the trigger, electroweak physics and B-physics. He has been the second supervisor of 2 undergraduate students at University of Roma3. He has been member of the organizing committee for the international workshops: Vertex 2016, MOCAST 2015 and 2016, Workshop on Intelligent Trackers (WIT) 2012, 2014, 2016. Committment: 15\%. 
\item  Prof. Chiara Roda is the Pisa ATLAS group team leader (20 members). She has or has had leading and coordination roles in ATLAS both in detector performance and in physics analysis. She has been editor for publications on jet cross-section, diboson production, exotic searches in diboson. She has supervised 4 PhD theses, 10 master theses and many diploma thesis at the University of Pisa. She co-teaches the HEP laboratory course for master students. Committment: 10\%.
