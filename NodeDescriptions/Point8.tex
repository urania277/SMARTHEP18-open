\begin{enumerate}%[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-2pt,leftmargin=*]
\item Tobias Brambach holds a doctorate in experimental particle physics from TU Dortmund University. 
During his PhD, he worked on flavour tagging calibrations for the LHCb experiment. 
He was also responsible for supervising numerous students on their bachelor, master, and PhD theses. 
Afterwards, he occupied a leading role in sales and project management at Cognitas GmbH (now a Canon company) before he founded \pointeight. 
At \pointeight, Tobias is responsible for client development, data
science projects, and human resources. 
\textbf{Role:} industrial supervisor of 
\ESRi.
Committment: 10\%. 
\item Kevin Dungs decided to leave CERN after his Master's degree to join Google as a software engineer. 
At CERN, he worked on algorithms for real-time data-analysis and monitoring. 
At Google, he implemented large-scale efficient algorithms that power shipping cost and date calculations in Google Shopping. 
After two years at Google, he joined \pointeight as a partner. 
At \pointeight, Kevin is responsible for software engineering as well
as research and development. \textbf{Role:} industrial supervisor of
\ESRe and \ESRn. Committment: 10\%.
