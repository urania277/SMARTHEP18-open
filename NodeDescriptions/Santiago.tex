The Instituto Galego de Fisica de Altas Enerxias (IGFAE) is a mixed institute between the regional government of Galicia and the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela (USC). 
Universidade de Santiago de Compostela (USC) is one of the oldest universities in Europe and one of Spains top universities. The IGFAE is one the most scientifically productive centers of the USC. Indeed, it is the only institute in the region recognized as Unit of Excellence (via de Maria de Maeztu Program of the Spanish government) and one of the four on Particle Physics in Spain. The IGFAE has 28 faculty members, 12 postdocs, 31 PhD students and 2 emeriti. \Bstrut}\tabularnewline\hline

\item Diego Martinez is Distinguished Researcher at Axencia Galega de Innovacion (GAIN), from the industry department of the regional government. He has extensive experience on LHCb data analysis and is PI of an ERC-StG-639068. 
\item Veronika Chobanova is convener of B decays to charmonia, being the only member of a Spanish institution at the Physics Planning Group of LHCb. She is also co-PI of a national project of 133k euro, and outreach convener of IGFAE.
