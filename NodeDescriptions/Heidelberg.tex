\heidelberglong  was established in 1386 and is the oldest university in Germany.  
It has twelve faculties with a total of more than 30,000 students. 
The Department of Physics and Astronomy is the largest physics department in Germany with
350 new incoming students and more than 100 PhD degrees per year.
It follows the idea of teaching rooted in research and sees its research programme at the borders of knowledge as a pre-requisite for teaching and training its students at high quality. 
The both experimental institutes involved in this application, the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics (KIP) and the Physikalisches Institut (PI), perform research in the areas of classic complex systems, quantum systems, heavy ion physics, atomic physics  as well as in fundamental particle physics.

\item Prof.~Dr.~Stephanie Hansmann-Menzemer is a full professor at the PI of the \hd.
  She has a strong background in flavour physics, with focus on mixing and CP violation. Furthermore she is an expert in
  tracking algorithms and core software development for online and offline application and involved in the development of the
  readout-system for the upgrade of the LHCb forward tracking system. She worked on the CDF~II experiment at the Tevatron accelerator from 1999-2006 and joined the LHCb collaboration in 2006. Since 2017 she is member of the DARWIN collaboration, a future liquide xenon based direct detection experiment for Dark Matter.
  Prof.~Dr.~Hansmann-Menzemer won several prestiges research prices, among others the EPS young researcher award (2007), an Emmy-Noether young investigator grant (2006) and an ERC starting grant (2010).
  She is vice dean of the faculty and co-spokesperson of the research training {\itshape Particle Physics Beyond the Standard Model} of the german research foundation (DFG). She has supervised 15
  PhD students as primary advisor.
  Role: co-supervisor of \ESRn and academic contact. Commitment: 10\%

\item Dr.~Martino Borsato is a postdoctoral researcher at the PI of \hd. He has a strong background in rare $B$ decays, Lepton Flavour Universality tests, direct searches for light dark sector particles and also SUSY and Dark Matter phenomenology. For these analysis he has developed advanced machine learning techniques as well as modern parallel architectures. He is currently convener of the LHCb Run 1-2 performance working-group and has convened the LHCb Exotica physics-analysis subgroup in 2017 and 2018. He has a European-wide profile as he studied in Italy, got his PhD in France and has been a PostDoc in Spain and Germany.
Role: co-supervisor of \ESRn. Commitment: 20\%. 

\item apl.~Prof.~Dr.~Monica Dunford is researcher group leader at the University of Heidelberg. She has been a member of the ATLAS collaboration since 2006 and has been active in the hadronic calorimeter, the trigger system, precision measurements of the Standard Model as well as searches for Dark Matter. She was also a member of the SNO collaboration, where she did hardware development and energy reconstruction algorithms for Cherenkov detectors. She has supervised or co-supervised eight PhD students in addition to many masters and bachelors students. She is on the programming boards for several international conferences in LHC physics.
  Role: co-supervisor of \ESRl and academic contact. Commitment: 10\%.


\item Dr.~Pavel Starovoitov is a postdoctoral researcher  at \hd, and a member of the ATLAS Collaboration since 2000. He is leading the Tile Calorimeter Upgrade Simulation group of the ATLAS experiment.  He was the convener of the PDF Fit Forum and of the Jets and Photon Physics working group  in  ATLAS Collaboration. He has supervised and co-supervised in total six PhD students at the University of Hamburg, the Belarus State University and at Heidelberg University and worked with several Master and Bachelor students. Dr.~Starovoitov was the holder of the  Marie-Curie Incoming International Fellowship, CERN-INTAS Young Scientist Fellowship.
Role: main supervisor of \ESRl and recruitment officer. Commitment: 20\%.

\hdshort The ATLAS and LHCb physics group at KIP and PI have their own computing farms with about 800 worker nodes and more than a Petabyte of  disk space for fast local data analysis. 
The farms are connected to the Worldwide HEP grid network as well as to the German national analysis facility (NAF) with several thousands computing cores and Petabytes of disk space. The both experimental institutes are equipped with mechanical and electronic workshops with all together 65 technicians and engineers, which made leading contributions  to the design, construction and commissioning of e.g. the ALICE Transition Radiation Detector, the LHCb Outer tracker and the Scintillating Fibre Tracker for the upgrade and the ATLAS Calorimeter. %

  Due to the large students body and the large number of professors -- about 45 full professors and 30 professors from associated research institutes such as for example the Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics, the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy or the Heidelberg Institute for
  Theoretical Studies -- the physics curriculum is very broad and offers many attractive specialisations. 
  Furthermore all PhD students from \hdshort ATLAS and LHCb groups are enrolled in the Heidelberg Graduate School for Physics (HGSFP). In addition to providing excellent  education in astronomy and cosmics physics, particle physics, quantum dynamics,	cosmology, mathematical physics, HGSFP  aims to train young scientists to be able to  cross the boundaries between different fields of fundamental physics. Furthermore the department is running three research training networks in the area of particle physics.  
  GRK1940  {\itshape Particle Physics Beyond the Standard Model}, which is especially focusing on strengthening the links between experimental and theoretical physics and GRK2058 {\itshape High Rate and High Resolution Detectors for Nuclear and Particle Physics} are both DFG funded research training groups. The third research training group {\itshape Precision Tests of Fundamental Symmetries} is jointly operated with the Max-Planck-Institute for nuclear physics and funded by the Max-Planck-Society.
  The standard curriculum as well as the dedicated courses of the HGSFP and the three research training groups in particle physics are open for students of the SMARTHEP RTN.\\
The \heidelberglong participates in  112  projects within FP7 and 49 projects within H2020 programs, where it leads 49 and 26 projects respectively. It includes both collaborative and individual grants.  %For example, The \hdshort group has running EU FP7 training network grant PicoSEC-MCNet
