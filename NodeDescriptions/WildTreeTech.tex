\wildtree is a remote-first company operating globally with headquarter in Switzerland. 
Wild Tree Tech is part of an open-source consortium operating
mybinder.org which provided on-demand computing for 9000 unique users,
predominantly academic researchers, in December 2017.

\item Tim Head holds a doctorate in experimental particle physics from
  the University of Manchester. Following his PhD he worked as a
  research fellow at CERN on the LHCb project for two years. Here he
  helped prove the feasibility of and laid the foundation for
  performing real-time data analysis. He continued this work for 18
  months at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne. Tim has been
  a mentor and organiser in the Mozilla Open Leadership Training since
  2015. Since 2016 Tim has been working as a data-science consultant
  for industry and academia. 
10\% of his time will be committed to the project.

We rent cloud computing facilities on demand to fulfil the operational
needs of our global customer base. By not owning any physical
equipment ourselves we reduce operating costs and maintain full
flexibility. 
Staff have access to the ImpactHub co-working space in Zurich and
ImpactHub's 95 other locations.
