\pbox{0.85\textwidth}{\Tstrut Lund University is active with a strong, long-term contribution to the ATLAS Experiment and the ALICE Experiment.
This ITN fits well the research interests and existing efforts in the group: an ongoing ERC StG, held by Doglioni, includes real-time data analyses
in searches for new physics in jet final states.   
The opportunities for collaboration within the group are strong as the ESRs in this project extend the research program, and there is sufficient room for a clearly defined, original line of research for the students in this project.   
The expertise that can be found in the theoretical physics department of Lund is also invaluable for all physics searches and measurements
in this ITN: the \textsc{Pythia} event generator developed in Lund is the most used for the simulation of both signal and background 
events for jet searches in the ATLAS Collaboration. 
In \lundlong, the ESRs will also benefit from the use of a computing cluster connected to the NorduGrid network, which can be used for fast and efficient data analysis. 
The combination of a strong understanding of the theoretical issues for the comparison of collider Dark Matter searches and a hands-on experience with LHC data will be conducive to developments and collaboration between the beneficiaries of this project, other Swedish Universities contributing to Dark Matter searches within ATLAS and the Swedish NORDITA Dark Matter program that can be undertaken during and beyond the time frame of this project. 
Furthermore, there are two major research facilities in Lund: MAX IV, a world-leading synchrotron radiation laboratory which has opened in 2016, and the European Spallation Source (ESS), a European facility that will host the most powerful neutron source. 
We plan to exploit existing collaborations with researchers at ESS and MAX IV though on the topics within this ITN, allowing cross-pollination of ideas from the visiting researchers and industrial partners that will be beneficial for the training of students resident or seconded in Lund within and beyond the network.

\pbox{0.85\textwidth}{\Tstrut \lundlong has been and is currently involved in several EU funded projects, in a number of disciplines, hosting several ERC (starting and advanced) grants. 
One of them is the Doglioni's DARKJETS ERC, concerning discovery strategies for Dark Matter and other new phenomena at the LHC, which has a connection to this project. 
Lund particle physics is directly involved in the INSIGHTS ITN (GA No.765710), concerning statistics for physics and society, with which \acronym plans to collaborate in co-organizing a training event. 
Even though Doglioni was the original \lundentity responsible for INSIGHTS, the role of local node coordinator has been assigned to Else Lytken, allowing Doglioni to have time to be PC of \acronym if funded. 
We also plan to collaborate with the~\href{http://www.montecarlonet.org/}{MCNet ETN}, that has a long tradition in Lund.} \tabularnewline\hline\Tstrut
