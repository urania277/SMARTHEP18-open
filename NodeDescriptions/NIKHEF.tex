\pbox{8cm}{\Tstrut General\\Description\Bstrut} & %
\pbox{19cm}{\Tstrut \nikhef is the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics, coordinating and 
leading the Dutch experimental activities in the fields of accelerator-based particle physics and 
astroparticle physics, with the mission of studying the interactions and structure of all elementary 
particles and fields at the smallest distance scale and the highest attainable energy. \nikhef is a 
partnership between the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM, part of NWO, the 
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research) and four universities: Radboud University 
Nijmegen, University of Amsterdam, Utrecht University and VU University Amsterdam. The research at 
NIKHEF relies on the development of innovative technologies. The knowledge and technology transfer 
to third parties, \ie, industry, civil society and general public, is an integral part of 
\nikhef mission. 
The \nikhef collaboration consists of about 200 physicists (60 tenured staff, 40 postdocs, 100 \phd 
students), 75 technical and engineering staff and 25 support staff and has at present seven 
experimental research lines (ATLAS, ALICE, LHCb, Gravitational Waves, Dark Matter, Neutrino 
Telescopes and Cosmic Rays), and in addition research lines on Theoretical Physics, Detector R\&D 
and Physics Data Processing, supporting the experimental effort. Several members of the tenured staff
also are professor at the partner universities, and through these channels \phd students can be
awarded their doctoral degree at the partner universities.
The FOM-institute \nikhef is located 
in the Amsterdam Science Park. \Bstrut}\tabularnewline\hline
