	\pbox{179mm}{\textbf{\Tstrut Description of Work and Role of Partners:}
The WP3 coordinator is Dr. V. Gligorov from \cnrs, an institute whose members have wide experience in advanced
data analysis and ML techniques. The WP3 coordinator is responsible for the coherence and interaction of the ESRs investigating 
Machine Learning techniques throughout \acronym, for their development and their application to HEP and commercial use cases according to
the network-wide strategy described in Fig.~\ref{fig:implementation}. 
He will also ensure that sustainable code is written alongside documentation that makes the software useful and usable, and  
that frameworks and toolkits are made public in a timely manner and respecting IP clauses in case of commercial exploitation.

{\textbf{\Tstrut Deliverables:} 
Deliverables of WP3 include ML software for the improvement of jet reconstruction and tagging in CMS and
related technical publications (\deli{\deliverableCMSHLTDNNJEC}, \deli{\deliverableHEPPubCMSHLTDNNJEC}, \deli{\deliverableCMSHLTGeneralPurposeScouting}), 
the creation of toolkits for trigger optimization (\deli{\deliverableTechPubMLForOptimisation}, \deli{\deliverableTriggerOptToolkit})
and publications related to the commercial software for the creation of 
adversarial networks examples and combination of
time-ordered and non-time-ordered sources in industry and HEP in collaboration with WP6 (\deli{\deliverableTechPubAdversarialFramework}, \deli{\deliverableTechPubTimeOrderedSourcesFramework})
%and relative peer-reviewed publications on physics applications in collaboration with WP5.
