The WP4 coordinator is Dr. L. Lacassagne from \cnrs. He is a system architect with extensive experience in
the benchmarking and use of hybrid architectures. 
The WP4 coordinator is responsible for the coherence and interaction of the ESRs developing code and testing it on systems that are 
not only composed of ordinary CPUs, following the strategy described in Fig.~\ref{fig:implementation}. 
He is responsible for the  publication and exploitation of successful deliverables related to hybrid architectures, 
as well as many studies that demonstrated that standard architectures are not as well suited for the purpose of real-time analysis. 
Together with the \ohio, \santiago and \pisa partners oversees the training programme on 
each specific architecture (FPGA), and ensures the quality of lectures and their proceedings with the coordinator of WP2. 
He also makes sure that code written for non-standard architectures satisfies sustainability and documentation standards.

{\textbf{\Tstrut Deliverables:} 
Deliverables of WP4 include the creation of toolkits for the optimization of specific hybrid architectures in HEP like the ATLAS FTK (\deli{\deliverableToolkitTrainingFTK}),
and for more general benchmarking (\deli{\deliverableTechPubHybrid}). Publications concerning multithreading (\deli{\deliverableTechPubMultithreaded}) and 
applications of hybrid architectures in the ATLAS and LHCb triggers are also under the purview of WP4 (\deli{\deliverableTechPubLLPGPU)}, \deli{\deliverableHEPPubATLASFTK}, \deli{\deliverableHEPPubHybrid}). 
The related HEP publications are deliverables in collaboration with WP5. A joint deliverable of WP2 and WP4 is the design, organization and documentation of the FPGA and GPU schools (\deli{2.2}).
