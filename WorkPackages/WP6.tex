\pbox{179mm}{\textbf{\Tstrut Description of Work and Role of Partners:} 
\dq is chosen as the lead beneficiary of WP6 with N. Meric as contact,
following the Prix AirFrance awards at the 2015 Web Summit, 
given their experience in technology transfer, 
and the extensive past and present experience of their members in both industry and HEP. 
They receive the support of a second coordinator, P. Starovoitov from \heidelberg
with complementary expertise, ensuring that the exchange between academia and industry is fruitful 
in both directions. The WP6 coordinators follow the industrial secondments and 
have a coherent view of the deliverables so that they fit within the overall network programme. 
The deliverables of WP6 match the research objectives and include all commercial applications of RTA: 
they consist of toolkits within ML and AI for mobile platform, 
RTA for medical and financial application and for process optimization (\task{6.1}-\task{6.4}). 
The WP6 coordinators ensure that these commercial deliverables are disseminated and documented after 
their exploitation, as well as correctly handled in terms of IP. The WP6 coordinators maintain the communications with the European IPR Helpdesk. 
They organize the \acronym school focused on industrial and commercials topics (\task{6.5}).
