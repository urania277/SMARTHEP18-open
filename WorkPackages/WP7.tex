\pbox{179mm}{\textbf{\Tstrut Description of Work and Role of
    Partners:}  
WP7 is detailed further in Sec.~\ref{sec:CommPub}. 
\cern is chosen as the lead beneficiary of WP7
%following the Prix AirFrance awards at the 2015 Web Summit and 
given their extensive experience in communicating with the public. 
The WP6 coordinator organises the communication of \acronym to two main audiences: the general public and the scientific community.  
%The \url{www.smarthep.org} is instrumental in both cases, hence 
\task{6.1} consists in setting up a dedicated outreach portal together with the PC for 
the communication platform \url{www.smarthep.org}, which is supported by social media activities.
The communication to the scientific communities is achieved by poster and talk contributions to conferences. The coordinator will monitor the quality of the material presented by the ESRs and make sure they benefit from a outstanding international visibility (\task{6.2}). 
A crucial scientific deliverable will be the articles reporting on the activities of the Network. As \task{6.3}, the coordinator will ensure a consistent top quality of the paper produced within the Network. The outreach to the general public will take the form of visits to schools, guided visits to the CERN facilities, and the public lectures and "science on tap" at the network events (\task{6.4}). The dissemination activities of \acronym will completed by the delivery of the \acronym Masterclass exercise (\task{6.5}). These tasks will ensure that the general public will grasp the impact of \acronym on academia and HEP, industry and everyday life. All academic and industrial partners will take an active part in the WP7 activities, and in particular they will simultaneously host 
%provide the material and local connection for 
the International Masterclass exercise.
