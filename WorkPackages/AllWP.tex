Doglioni as Project Coordinator (PC) will oversee the smooth running of the planned research and training activities for the network.
\lund has been chosen to coordinate \acronym as a large institution with dedicated support and experience with projects of this kind, and due to Doglioni's experience in coordinating HEP communities and groups within and beyond ATLAS  (e.g. LHC Dark Matter Working Group, more than 300 participants and HEP Software Foundation trigger and reconstruction WG). 
Doglioni is an alumna of the \href{http://www.collegiocavalieri.it/en}{Collegio Universitario Lamaro Pozzani}, funded by the Italian National Federation of Holders of the Order of Merit for Labour. 
The Collegio hosts up to 15 selected Italian students per year, complementing their regular university education with courses and lectures in entrepreneurship, law, IT and languages.
This gives her an unique perspective on cross-talk between academia and industry that started developing as early as her undergraduate education. 
Administrative support to the PC will be hired, at the level of at least 50\% FTE. %(\task{1.1}). 
The PC will keep close contact with other WP coordinators to monitor the execution of tasks, and  compliance to the defined milestones.
The PC's first task will be to convene discussions leading to the signature of the Consortium Agreement (CA). %(\task{1.2}).
Management will coordinate the hiring of all ESRs together with a dedicated recruitment officer.% (\task{1.3}, \task{1.4}).
The PC is responsible for preparing and chairing the consortium administrative meetings in the EB and SB, for the preparation of reports for the EU together with the project manager, and for overseeing the election of ESR representatives to the EB and SB. %(\task{1.5}), 
The PC and the relevant WP coordinators oversee the organization of the planned workshops and conferences % (\task{1.6}). 
The PC is responsible for facilitating communication between the nodes, building lasting collaborations between the nodes, enabling knowledge transfer and forming a legacy of future research collaborations.

The goal of WP6 is to employ real-time analysis to detect novelty or anomalies while monitoring complex systems and streams of data. 
These data streams range from LHC collision events (\lundentity), to financial transactions (\ibmentity), to data from vehicle dashboard cameras (\fleetmaticsentity), to sensor data from industrial processes (\lightboxentity). 
A sub-goal that is novel to \acronym and essential to introduce such techniques in HEP trigger systems is the accountability and reproducibility of the algorithms employed, developed in \ESRx. 
For this reason, \ibmentity is chosen as the lead beneficiary of WP6 with De Sainte Marie as main coordinator, given his extensive experience in supervision of student projects and his expertise on symbolic knowledge systems. 
WP6's academic co-coordinator is Pierini (\cern), one of the pioneers of anomaly detection in LHC experiments. 
WP6 will work in close collaboration with WP3 to design new algorithms and combine the best of both symbolic knowledge and numerical algorithms towards application to HEP triggers and society. 
The deliverables of WP6 match the research objectives and include applications both in HEP and in the commercial sector, as the algorithms developed can be ported to the different kinds of data. 
Aided by the WP7 coordinator, by LU Innovation from the PC side and by the H2020 IPR helpdesk, WP6 coordinators ensure that these commercial deliverables are disseminated and documented after their exploitation, and correctly handled in terms of IP and \href{http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm}{EU General Data Protection Regulation}.
