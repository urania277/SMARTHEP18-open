Doglioni as Project Coordinator (PC) will oversee the smooth running of the planned research and training activities for the network.
\lund has been chosen to coordinate \acronym %and as lead beneficiary of WP0 
as a large institution with dedicated
support and experience with projects of this kind, and due to Doglioni's experience in coordinating HEP communities
and groups within and beyond ATLAS  (e.g. LHC Dark Matter Working Group, more than 300 participants). 
Doglioni is an alumna of the \href{http://www.collegiocavalieri.it/en}{Collegio Universitario Lamaro Pozzani},

funded by the Italian National Federation of Holders of the Order of Merit for Labour, 
that hosts up to 15 selected Italian students per year, complementing their regular university education with courses and lectures in entrepreneurship, law, IT and languages.
This gives her an unique perspective on cross-talk between academia and industry that started developing as early as her undergraduate education. 
Administrative support to the PC will be hired, at the level of at least 50\% FTE. %(\task{1.1}). 
She will keep close contact with other WP coordinators to monitor the execution of tasks, and  compliance to the defined milestones.
The PC's first task will be to convene discussions leading to the signature of the Consortium Agreement (CA). %(\task{1.2}).
Management will coordinate the hiring of all ESRs together with a dedicated recruitment officer.% (\task{1.3}, \task{1.4}).
The PC is responsible for preparing and chairing the consortium administrative meetings in the EB and SB,

and for overseeing the election of ESR representatives to the EB and SB.% after their recruitment. 
%The first of those, the Kick-off meeting is of prime importance to oversee the recruitment of the ESRs.
The PC and the relevant WP coordinators oversee the organization of the planned workshops and conferences % (\task{1.6}).

builds lasting collaborations between the nodes, enabling knowledge transfer and
forming a legacy of future research collaborations.
