Doglioni as Project Coordinator (PC) will oversee the smooth running of the planned research and training activities for the network.
\lund has been chosen to coordinate \acronym as a large institution with dedicated support and experience with projects of this kind, and due to Doglioni's experience in coordinating HEP communities and groups within and beyond ATLAS  (e.g. LHC Dark Matter Working Group, more than 300 participants and HEP Software Foundation trigger and reconstruction WG). 
Doglioni is an alumna of the \href{http://www.collegiocavalieri.it/en}{Collegio Universitario Lamaro Pozzani}, funded by the Italian National Federation of Holders of the Order of Merit for Labour and hosting up to 15 selected Italian students per year, complementing their regular university education with courses and lectures in entrepreneurship, law, IT and languages.
This gives her an unique perspective on cross-talk between academia and industry that started developing as early as her undergraduate education. 
Administrative support to the PC will be hired, at the level of at least 50\% FTE. %(\task{1.1}). 
The PC will keep close contact with other WP coordinators to monitor the execution of tasks, and  compliance to the defined milestones.
The PC's first task will be to convene discussions leading to the signature of the Consortium Agreement (CA). %(\task{1.2}).
Management will coordinate the hiring of all ESRs together with a dedicated recruitment officer.% (\task{1.3}, \task{1.4}).
The PC is responsible for preparing and chairing the consortium administrative meetings in the EB and SB, for the preparation of reports for the EU together with the project manager, and for overseeing the election of ESR representatives to the EB and SB. %(\task{1.5}), 
The PC and the relevant WP coordinators oversee the organization of the planned workshops and conferences % (\task{1.6}). 
The PC is responsible for facilitating communication between the nodes, building lasting collaborations between the nodes, enabling knowledge transfer and forming a legacy of future research collaborations.

WP6's academic co-coordinator is Pierini (\cern), one of the pioneers of anomaly detection in LHC experiments. 
WP6 will work in close collaboration with WP3 to design new algorithms and combine the best of both symbolic knowledge and numerical algorithms towards application to HEP triggers and society. 
The deliverables of WP6 match the research objectives and include applications both in HEP and in the commercial sector, as the algorithms developed can be ported to the different kinds of data.

Since the \acronym data challenge is a central piece of our outreach strategy, Ustyuzhanin from \cernentity and Yandex will be responsible for part of this effort benefitting from his expertise and work. 
Further outreach to the general public will take the form of visits to schools, guided visits to CERN facilities, public lectures and "science on tap" at Network events, while stakeholders and politicians will be reached by work with the dedicated research officers in the nodes national embassies.  
These will be complemented by a specific \acronym IPPOG Masterclass exercise.
These tasks will ensure the general public grasps the impact of \acronym on academia and HEP, industry and everyday life and actively participates in it through the data challenge.
All academic and industrial partners will take an active part in the WP7 activities, and will simultaneously host online the International Masterclass exercises and World Wide Data Day (WWDD) activities, including on the International Day of Women in Science day.
