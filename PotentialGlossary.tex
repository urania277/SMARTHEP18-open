%The ATLAS trigger infrastructure has an unique hardware processor to reconstruct the trajectory (tracking) of the charged particles that cross the silicon inner tracker of the experiment. The tracking information is an essential tool for effective real-time event selection and has a central role in the whole ATLAS physics program especially in the HL-LHC phase. The current hardware processor, FTK, is a complex system made by several custom electronics  boards based on FPGAs and Associative Memory chips. The latter are unique computing devices developed for the FTK algorithm. The hardware tracking will be also a central part of the Phase-II Upgrade of ATLAS, with upgraded version of FTK called FTK++.
