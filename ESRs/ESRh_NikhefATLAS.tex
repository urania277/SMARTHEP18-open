\multicolumn{6}{|p{21.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:} Instead of focusing on specific physics processes to choose what is "interesting", \ESRh will investigate a more generic approach - what are the bottlenecks in our trigger algorithms, what prevents us to record events we want and how to do more interesting physics with the same or even fewer resources. 
\ESRh's first objective will be to simplify, streamline and optimize the process of testing and benchmarking ATLAS triggers, by creating software tools that will analyze the performance of each trigger line, the resources used by each line, and their commonalities. 
\ESRh will also study how to reduce the consumption of resources by trigger lines using ML algorithms. 
A secondment at CERN under the supervision of  physicists from the \oregonentity will prove that these tools are useful within the ATLAS trigger, testing the performance of the algorithms developed by \ESRh on chains that make use of FTK.
As the tools developed by \ESRh will be experiment-independent, they will be portable and useful for applications for other LHC and future experiments. 
Specifically, we will design the tools together with LHCb trigger colleagues (\ESRi), and for different computing architectures (\ESRg).
\ESRh will be seconded with Ximantis and work on hybrid networks (e.g. Convolutional Neural Network followed by Long Short-Term Memory recurrent networks) which can capture features in different dimensionalities (e.g. space and time for traffic monitoring and forecasting). 
\ESRh will monitor the performance of these algorithms compared to the existing ones in the app, in an effort to make the developed tools fully environment independent, and provide a set of improvements for the app as its second objective. 
\ESRh will then test whether this kind of networks can help increasing the efficiency of trigger lines. 
\ESRh's third objective will be to search for LFV in the $\tau\to 3\mu$ process with ATLAS Run 3 data, where the optimization of the analysis chain resource consumption is critical and will use previously developed tools.

\multicolumn{6}{|p{21.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Expected Results:}1. With \ESRi, determine resources and bottlenecks in trigger systems, and identify how to optimize them (toolkit and peer-reviewed paper).

3. Implement optimization for FTK triggers chains (with \oregonentity at CERN).
