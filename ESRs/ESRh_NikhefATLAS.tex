\multicolumn{4}{l|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Title: Optimization of RTA resources and LFV search with ATLAS}
}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{8}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:}
\ESRh will study and be trained in advanced ML methods for RTA in both HEP and industry, and apply these methods to the optimization of resources for RTA, searches for LFV, and the optimization of ultrasound image simulation.
Instead of focusing on specific physics processes and separation of signal versus background based on their characteristics, \ESRh investigate a more generic approach - what are the bottlenecks in our trigger algorithms, what prevents us to record events we want and how to do more exciting physics with the same or even less resources we have. 
\ESRh's first objective will be to simplify, streamline and optimize the process of testing and benchmarking ATLAS triggers, by creating software tools that will analyze the performance of each trigger line, 
the resources used by each line, and their commonalities. \ESRh will also study how to reduce the consumption of resources by trigger lines using ML algorithms. 
A secondment at CERN under the supervision of  physicists from the \oregonentity will prove that these tools are useful within the ATLAS trigger, testing the performance of the algorithms developed by \ESRh on the upcoming chains using the FTK.
As the tools developed by \ESRh will not use any physics characteristics they will be portable and useful for applications independently of the experiment. 
Specifically, we will design the tools together with LHCb trigger colleagues (\ESRi), and for different computing architectures (ESR10).
\ESRh's second objective will be to search for LFV in the $\tau\to 3\mu$ process with ATLAS data, where the optimization of the analysis chain resource consumption is critical and will use the tools developed by \ESRh.
\ESRh will be seconded with Ximantis and work on hybrid networks (e.g. Convolutional Neural Network followed by Long Short-Term Memory recurrent networks) which can capture features in different dimensionalities (e.g. space and time for traffic monitoring and forecasting). 
\ESRh will monitor the performance of these algorithms compared to the existing ones in the app, in an effort to make the developed tools fully environment independent. 
\ESRh will then test whether this kind of networks can help monitoring trigger lines and making them more efficient.

\multicolumn{8}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Expected Results:}
Inter-experiment toolkit for trigger benchmarking and optimization (with \ESRi), a related peer-reviewed publication, a technical publication on used ML methods. 
The toolkit will be released for use in industry, and contribute to the optimization of the \ximantisentity app using hybrid networks. 
The physics research will lead to a peer-reviewed publication on LFV.
\ESRh will receive a PhD in experimental HEP at \radboudentity.
