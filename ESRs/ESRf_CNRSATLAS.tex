\multicolumn{2}{l|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Title: Real-time trajectory reconstruction in ATLAS} %for online event selection and analysis
}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:}
\ESRf will be trained in the real-time reconstruction of trajectories and images in both HEP and industry, and apply them to the reconstruction and analysis of particle trajectories in ATLAS as well as GPS data processing. 
The hardware tracking processors FTK/FTK++ allow ATLAS to find particle trajectories in real time. 
Their performances such as efficiency and resolution are not determined just by the hardware, but also by a learned database of pattern bank and geometrical constants.
\ESRf's first objective will be to deploy statistical and computing techniques, e.g. Principal Component Analysis and Graph Clustering, in order to produce new databases for FTK and evaluate their impact on raw performances and physics analyses.
\ESRf's second objective will be to extend the application of FTK-like algorithms outside of HEP, by providing flexible and powerful tools to train datasets.
These inter-sector toolkits will be developed during the secondment at \fleetmaticsentity, and tested at \pisaentity, whose geographical proximity allows for a seamless integration of the work done in both.
At \fleetmaticsentity \ESRf will be trained in the continuous online learning of ML models based on streams of labelled data, and in both the \apachespark\enspace and the Amazon Web Services infrastructures for massively parallel computations.
\ESRf will develop an online learning tool to continuously process real-time GPS data from Fleetmatics customers, providing customers with smart insights, improving customer experience, and thus increasing engagement with \fleetmaticsentity products. 
The acquired skills will feed back into the main research project and be applied to the FTK working dataset production. 
\ESRf's third objective will be to investigate in detail the impact of new training on selected physics cases.
In particular FTK tracks will be used to improve jet reconstruction and calibration, namely for the suppression of pile-up jets and the track-based components of the global sequential calibration, in collaboration with \ESRl. 
This will enhance the sensitivity of RTA NP searches with dijet mass distributions.
}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Expected Results:}
Two peer-reviewed papers, one documenting the toolkits and the improvements on the tracking performance, and one documenting the RTA of dijet mass distributions using FTK tracks. 
The toolkits developed for the training of FTK datasets will be adapted for usage outside of ATLAS and released. 
\ESRf will receive a PhD in experimental HEP at \sorbonneentity.

%The ATLAS trigger infrastructure has an unique hardware processor to reconstruct the trajectory (tracking) of the charged particles that cross the silicon inner tracker of the experiment. The tracking information is an essential tool for effective real-time event selection and has a central role in the whole ATLAS physics program especially in the HL-LHC phase. The current hardware processor, FTK, is a complex system made by several custom electronics  boards based on FPGAs and Associative Memory chips. The latter are unique computing devices developed for the FTK algorithm. The hardware tracking will be also a central part of the Phase-II Upgrade of ATLAS, with upgraded version of FTK called FTK++.
