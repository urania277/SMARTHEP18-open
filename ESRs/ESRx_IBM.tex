\ESRx will contribute to the next generation of AI that bridges a data driven automated learning with human-readable rules in real-time decision making. 

An example of real time decision making that combines analytics and knowledge based models is fraud detection, notably in banking. Payment platforms detect in real time fraudulent transactions. Such a detection of billions of events per day combines recognition of human created patterns articulated on their banking symbolic knowledge model, defined using concepts like merchant and debit card, plus relations between them. In addition predictive models are run to discover emerging fraud patterns by detecting new trends and anomalies. 
Organizations usually manually inject or transform their machine learnt patterns into symbolic models for interpretability, reproducibility and transparency. The goal of this PhD thesis is instead to automate the learning of a symbolic model. 

In this thesis the student will work on new combinations of statistical and knowledge based models for a better decision automation in fraud detection and in high energy physics, for the recognition of human-created (fraud) and non-human-created (particle collision) patterns. While machine learning has been highly popular during the last years, their black box approach raises interpretability and explainability challenges. On the other hand, symbolic models, including rules, have been successful in making decisions more interpretable. Nevertheless they require to capture an existing knowledge or theory. 

In the context of real time decision automation \ESRx will test the proposed numeric to symbolic model inferences to detect anomalies, patterns and anti-patterns, combining the efficiency of the numerical machine learning and the explainability of the symbolic approach. They will inject theory (knowledge from the Standard Model in physics, fraud detection patterns in financial transactions) and combine it with predictive models to classify observations and add an interpretability layer.

\ESRx will explore different angles in how we intend to combine numerical and knowledge models. They will first induce a symbolic decision logic from numeric data, leveraging best breed predictive algorithms on data and infer symbolic rules from the predictive models, and based on this \ESRx will propose new algorithms to learn from the data and induce rules. The goal is to better capture and abstract the rules, while minimizing resource consumption.

These techniques will then be applied to the real-time analysis of LHCb data, as the co-supervisor will be Gligorov from CNRS/Sorbonne adding expertise. The aim is to prototype a trigger that is able to distinguish new physics processes from known physics. The rules according to which this trigger selects or discards an event are not defined a priori as it is normally done, but rather inferred starting from large samples of events that do not contain any new processes. The trigger would ?learn? the characteristics of the known Standard Model events from this dataset, and select events that do not fall into this category for further inspection. 

[TO BE UPDATED: link to the rest] The primary objective of the secondment project will be to explore advances in autoregressive generative models for the purpose of searching for new physics or detecting anomalies. This family of neural networks has recently demonstrated its capability of learning highly structured data, such as images or sound, at a high level of fidelity. In addition, autoregressive models offer access to the evaluation of the likelihood, which directly enables the detection of unlikely events.
