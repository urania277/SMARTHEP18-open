     MVA for LFV in unflavoured meson decays}
}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:}
%The objective of this ESR is to advance the level of studies of Lepton
%Flavour Violation (LFV) to the next level. 
ESR6 will develop unified real-time selections and models in HEP and industry, and be trained in state of the art AI and ML methods and algorithms for real-time applications.
ESR6 will work closely together with ESR5, and search
for LFV in neutral meson decays. Tests
by older experiments reach a precision of about one in a million for
decays of $\phi$, $J/\psi$ and $Y(1S)$ mesons, while the LHCb upgrade
%At the upgraded LHCb detector, many
%orders of magnitude more of these mesons are produced, 
could improve this precision by orders of magnitude. 
The difficult separation between these decays and the overwhelming background means the analysis must be done in real-time. ESR6's first objective will develop fast ML-based real time
selections for the unflavoured $\phi$, $J/\psi$ and $Y(1S)$ mesons decaying into the different
lepton species. 
%Because of the difficult experimental signatures, fast
%ML-based selections need to be developed, and 
ESR6 will be trained in optimizing ML selection algorithms for RTA applications, and implementing them within the LHCb trigger,
%This work will represent a
%significant extension to the , and 
benefiting from the existing expertise of the ERC StG group of J. Albrecht which the ESR will be attached to.   
ESR6 will be seconded to Ximantis, 
%which will
%cross-fertilise the real-time use of AI in the CERN experiment and in
%industry. The ESR will gain hands-on
where they will gain hands-on experience optimizing neural networks for traffic prediction applications, and receive training in current best practice in ML and AI. This additional industrial experience and training will allow ESR6 to gain vital perspective on what kinds of ML and AI methods are best suited to different types of real-time problems.
ESR6's second objective will be to use this training to enhance existing AI-based traffic modelling at Ximantis.
The CERN secondment will allow ESR6 to collaborate closely
with ESR5 and to be trained in trigger and RTA development by leading members of the LHCb CERN group.
ESR6's third objective will be the development of unified RTA selections for LFV decays of light and unflavoured particles in LHCb's trigger, in collaboration with ESR5.
%that inclusively select all particle decays to two different lepton
%species. 
%This will be done in collaboration with ESR5.  
ESR6's fourth objective will be to search for LFV in the decays of unflavoured mesons using the first Run~3 LHCb data. 
%The dataset has the potential to
%boost the precision of these tests for LFV by several orders of
%magnitude.   
%The ESR will receive training in RTA methods used in the LHCb trigger
%system.  
%ESR6 will become one of the trigger experts of LHCb's rare decay
%group.
