\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:}
The goal of this project is to, in partnership with a number of computing hardware companies, train \ESRg in programming for heterogeneous computing architectures, 
and in particular simultaneously optimizing data formats and processing techniques to enable CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, 
and hybrids to work together to solve problems which none of these technologies could solve on their own. 
The first objective of \ESRg will be to  design a novel ML method for optimizing heterogeneous computing architectures, and deploy it in the context of the specific requirements of real-time data processing in the LHC collaborations, with ATLAS and LHCb as main examples to exploit synergies with \ESRf and \ESRx based in the Paris area.
This method takes as input the cost of the various computing architectures under consideration, builds and emulates test processing systems, tests them using the task being optimized for and finds the most cost-effective one.
The second objective will be to apply this optimization code to the specific problems of the LHCb and ATLAS real-time data-processing architectures. 
This work will be done in collaboration with \ESRh and \ESRi, as they will prepare a software toolkit that can be used to benchmark these processes. 
}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Expected Results:}
This ESR project will lead to the release of a software package to optimize heterogeneous computing architectures and two peer-reviewed papers, one documenting the novel machine learning based optimization, and one documenting the possible applications of this method to the optimization of the LHCb and ATLAS real-time data processing. 
\ESRg will receive a PhD in experimental HEP at \sorbonneentity.

\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Secondments:}
A five-month secondment at \cernentity will allow for training in machine learning methods and interaction with the LHCb and ATLAS collaborators involved in the optimization of their respective real-time analysis systems, under the supervision of Petersen and Couturier.
