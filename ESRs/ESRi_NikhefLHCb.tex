\multicolumn{4}{l|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Title:  Optimization of RTA resources and LFV search with LHCb}
}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{8}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:}
\ESRi will collaborate closely with \ESRh on developing the toolkit for the optimization of the real-time trigger system of the main HEP experiments, and receive training in the same basic methods and techniques. 
\ESRi will focus on LHCb. Compared to ATLAS, LHCb generates an order of magnitude less data per collision at an order of magnitude larger rate. 
The requirement that the toolkit must work optimally for both experiments implies that it must be sufficiently generic and adaptable. As a result, it will also have applications beyond these two experiments.
The workload for the creation of this toolkit will be split between \ESRh and \ESRi, as both students will be working in synergy on the same topics, and will benefit from the supervision of both O. Igonkina and G. Raven.  In addition both ESRs will adapt and optimizing the toolkit for their respective experiments.
The work of \ESRi will be applied to the search for LFV in the $\tau\to\mu\gamma$ decay in LHCb, which currently does not have a dedicated trigger chain at LHCb. 
The high data rate of the upgraded LHCb experiment, in combination with the optimization of the trigger algorithms will allow to collect this kind of events and study a process that was previously thought to require dedicated experiments. 
A six-month secondment to Dortmund will allow \ESRi to receive expert training in the design of LFV analyses from Albrecht, and benefit from synergy between their work, the work of Albrecht's ESRs and the work of \ESRn who will be also seconded there. This will happen in tandem with a secondment at \pointeight where RTA techniques will be used for monitoring and decision-making in German industrial transport, with a project that is distinct yet connected to that of \ESRn. 
}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{8}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Expected Results:}
Inter-experiment toolkit for benchmarking and optimization of trigger systems (with \ESRh), a related peer-reviewed publication, a related publication on used ML methods.
The physics research will lead to a peer-reviewed publication on Lepton Flavor Violation. 
\ESRh will receive a PhD in experimental HEP at VU University Amsterdam.
