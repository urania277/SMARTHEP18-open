%%Explain the appropriateness of the infrastructure of each participating organisation, as outlined in Section 5 (Participating Organisations), in light of the tasks allocated to them in the action.
%
All nodes in the consortium have infrastructure appropriate to the tasks
they are responsible for. \lundentity's management is supported by its Research Services, 
which are appropriate for a large university. 
All ESRs will have access to the complete range of \acronym
expertise (Sec.~\ref{ss:competence_44}) and infrastructure (part B2),
and be provided with office space and a laptop for use during \acronym. 
Beneficiaries and the secondment officer will also help with accommodation,
visas and practical issues, making use of the EURAXESS Services for Relocation Assistance. 
Academic support granted to ESRs includes close supervision, mentoring by senior scientists and 
institutional academic literature subscriptions, as well all the facilities supporting research at the nodes. 
All institutes and research laboratories have software divisions with excellent computing
capabilities and infrastructure, including rack-mounted
servers and large data storage systems, locally and on the Worldwide Computing Grid. 

As detailed for each node in part B2, \acronym participants
contribute with the specific facilities and equipment required for the successful completion of the WPs.
In particular, partners hosting secondments involving GPUs and hybrid architectures host those on their premises
and ESRs will be able to use them during the secondment and remotely on demand. 
Moreover, a number of industrial entities have agreed with Prof. Lacassagne that \ESRg
will be able to make use of beyond-state-of-the-art machines to test algorithms developed
throughout the duration of \acronym, and that \ESRg will
be able to disseminate results in open access journals as soon as
the machines become public, within the course of their PhD project. 

\subsection{Competences, experience and complementarity of the participating organisations and their commitment to the program}
\label{ss:competence_44}

\subsubsection{Consortium composition and exploitation of participating organisations' complementarities}
\label{sub:composition}

The academic beneficiaries and partners of \acronym are the pioneers and experts of RTA in each of the LHC experiments. 
They have a strong background in the physics topics that are the focus of the network, as the network includes 5 ERC grantees and scientists who have covered and are covering positions of responsibilities within large international collaborations as detailed in Secs.~\ref{subsub:qual_supervisors} and part B2.
%Even though the network is mostly composed and led by early-career, emergent researchers, they all have extensive experience in student supervision and research. 
Researchers in \acronym have already been successfully collaborating within their experiments on complementary topics. 
Scientists in \nikhefentity, \cnrsentity, \dortmundentity (LHCb), \oregonentity, \ohioentity, \lundentity, \heidelbergentity (ATLAS), \helsinkientity (ATLAS)  and \lundentity (ALICE) lead the trigger and RTA techniques developments for each of the collaborations. 
Expertise in ML is given by \pointeightentity, \unigeentity, by LHCb researcher Ustyuzhanin from the Yandex School of Computing and \cernentity.  

The synergy in the RTA physics program of \acronym is cross-collaboration, with researchers from \nikhefentity, \cnrsentity and \dortmundentity researching LFV/LFU in ATLAS and LHCb, researchers from \unigeentity, \cernentity, \helsinkientity, \heidelbergentity, \oregonentity seek new physics through Higgs and dark sector particles in ATLAS and CMS, while \lundentity and \helsinkientity precisely measure the Standard Model of particle physics in CMS and ALICE. 
%The network also benefits from theory expertise with the affiliated theorists of Dark Matter and LFV/LFU from \ohioentity and \cincinnatientity. 
%The combination of WP4, led by one researcher per collaboration, and WP7 led by \cernentity
%will ensure that the results of physics research are disseminated and communicated effectively. 
%Hybrid architectures (WP5, led by L. Lacassagne of \cnrsentity) are another necessary ingredient of RTA,
%as software-only solutions on standard CPUs are not sufficiently fast for the purposes of HEP and industry alike. 

Software and machine-learning experts from \pointeightentity, \ximantisentity, \heidelberginstrumentsentity, \cernentity and \ibmentity as well as experts in hybrid infrastructures in \pisaentity, \cnrsentity, \fleetmaticsentity and \lightboxentity provide the complementary tools to develop efficient solutions to both industry and research problems, and in the case of the industrial partners, practical implementations with a commercial value. 
%The combination of Machine Learning, novel data analysis techniques and hybrid architectures are applied to commercial examples of real-time data analysis. 
%All commercial partners have a concrete interest in these techniques. 

The status of \cernentity as an international collaboration that hosts all HEP experiments provides the ideal framework in which to exploit the research complementarity within the network and support its 
advancements beyond the state of the art. An example is the recently Internet-of-Things Openlab effort at CERN\footnote{First workshop of Internet-of-Things at CERN, \url{https://indico.cern.ch/event/669690/overview}, Nov 2017} whose organizers informally agreed to support this network through a half-day training and presentation day. 
The participation of all LHC collaborations to \acronym and the explicit support of the HEP Software Foundation (see letter of support) offers a unique chance to form lasting collaborations and shape the future data taking strategies of LHC experiments and beyond, building from the  results obtained in \acronym.  

%%%%Non-academic

%As explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:supervision}, all the beneficiaries 
%%are either able to enrol the ESRs in their doctoral school programs
%%or have established co-supervision arrangements 
%%for the ESRs to obtain their  in another institution within the Network. 
%training in industry and knowledge transfer at \dq [mention heidelberg school]. 
%In particular the dedicated and hands-on \cern HEP schools and the [school of data analysis and ML]
%will complement the more traditional university-based lectures of other academic nodes, while
%\dq 
%%, \technopolis 
%and the partner companies will provide training which will greatly increase the employability of
%the ESRs. %Summer schools, academic lecture series as well as the full spectrum
%%of training courses offered by the \acronym participants will be open to all ESRs.

%The research synergies and complementarities

%The non-academic beneficiaries and partners have been chosen for their active involvement in research
%and development related to optimising decisions with a commercial purpose, 
%leading to a common interest in RTA shared with the \acronym participants, 
%as detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:EXCELLENCE}.

\subsubsection{Commitment of beneficiaries and partner organisations to the program}
%(for partner organisations, please see also sections 5 and 7).

While the majority of the \acronym academic participants are already successfully collaborating in research projects within the LHC experiments, this is the first network that including all major LHC experiment that will consistently advance RTA through Machine Learning and hybrid architectures for modern particle physics experiments and industry alike. 
In-person meetings for the members of the \acronym network have been taking place since May 2017\footnote{\href{https://indico.lucas.lu.se/event/656/}{SMARTHEP kickoff meeting}, supported by the Grace och Philip Sandbloms Fund}. A number of subsequent meetings have taken place, including the RAPID2018 workshop (Sec.~\ref{sec:synergy}), and culminated in a three-day workshop dedicated to the preparation and collaborative editing of this ITN \footnote{\href{https://indico.cern.ch/event/777802/}{SMARTHEP writing meeting at CERN}, supported by Lund Research Services}. SMARTHEP members have also secured funding for a 12 day RTA workshop at the \href{https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/institut-pascal}{Institut Pascal} (Sec.~\ref{sec:synergy}).
It is clear from the enthusiasm and participation of all members, as well as from the support offered to this network by \lundentity, that all \acronym participants are fully committed to this project.

High quality education of students in large-scale international projects is already an essential part of the mission of the universities and research labs in \acronym. 
\acronym will greatly strengthen and extend their capacities to carry out these activities, by dedicating a significant fraction of research and supervision time to \acronym activities (see node descriptions in part B2).
All industrial nodes are committed to \acronym, to benefit from the experience in RTA of LHC experts, to foster connections to the academic world and to expand their activities. 
The industry parties have a strong motivation to participate in cutting edge developments and the subsequent transfer of the technologies to new commercial applications.
\acronym partners will not only contribute training to the network, but will also benefit in their own research and commercial objectives through the secondment projects of the ESRs. 

The relations between the nodes, established starting from the preparation of the project will last even beyond \acronym: 
to organize post-graduate recruitment events for companies in the network that specifically target \acronym ESRs after the completion of their PhD and to continue the series of training events and offer them to the European graduate student community.  
%\acronym participants therefore have already established long-lasting
%and fruitful professional relations, marked by mutual respect and trust.
%In short, there is no doubt that all participants in \acronym
%will show the highest level of commitment to the research program.
