The training program of \acronym has three main {\bf objectives}, taking the Salzburg Principles\footnote{Salzburg II recommendations, \url{http://www.eua.be/Libraries/publications-homepage-list/Salzburg_II_Recommendations}} as a guidance: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Objective A}: provide ESRs with knowledge and training to conduct original research during \& beyond their PhD studies;
\item {\bf Objective B}: provide solid bases in a broad spectrum of topics related to their field of research, extending beyond their dedicated research and including soft skills; 
\item {\bf Objective C}: provide up-to-date and career-related training through interactions with multiple collaborators within academia as well as the industry, to meet the needs of a broad employment market.
\end{itemize}

Objectives A and B will be fulfilled by schools, workshops and events organized within the network; ESRs will profit from high quality lectures delivered by experts within the institutes associated to \acronym, complemented by doctoral training at local nodes. Objective C will be fulfilled by special network events where the industrial collaborators will provide seminars and training on commercial applications of \acronym's objectives, as well as career-focused aspects. All these objectives will be further addressed via the natural collaboration between the ESRs and the various institutes of the network, as well as the planned secondments in academia and industry. This is a more flexible and diverse structure with respect to standard PhD studies. It will allow the ESRs to develop an individual and unique research mindset within an inclusive environment, so that they can act as proactive participants in furthering HEP and industry goals through RTA techniques.

%%%PCDP 

\noindent \color{blue}Personal Career Development Plan. \color{black}
Two months after the start of their projects, ESRs will present a \textbf{Personal Career Development Plan} (PCDP) so that the \textbf{core, advanced and transferrable skills} to be acquired, as well as the milestone for each of the ESR projects, can be agreed between student and supervisor and consortium, planned and monitored throughout the course of the program. 
This will be done with the guidance of their supervisors, and will take into account the existing resources both at the ESR node and at foreseen secondments. The PCDP will be reviewed by the local node coordinator, who will bring it to the Supervisory Board (SB) for approval. The main supervisor will be available throughout the course of the PhD, and meet with the ESR on a weekly basis. 
The local node coordinator will also review the progress at minimum every six months (e.g. during staff appraisal meetings) and bring a short report to the consortium. 
%ESRs are expected to participate in one or two network-organized schools throughout
%their PhD, corresponding to up to 3 ECTS each, and one external summer or winter school. 
The PCDP\footnote{The \acronym PCDP will follow a common template based on that from the MSCA website to provide coherence between the ESRs} will include the requirements, milestones and goals within the schedule of the doctoral program (including secondments), the local and network-wide courses and schools to be attended, and a list of dissemination, communication and outreach activities. 

%	requirements and goals of the planned training for the ESR
%	A list of courses (local and network-wide) to be taken by the ESR during their program, including any ECTS credit requirements
%	A list of communication and dissemination activities to be undertaken by the ESR
%	A schedule for their program, including secondments

%Core Research Skills (acquired via their ESR project)
%Advanced/Additional Research Skills (delivered by the consortium)
%Transferable Skills (delivered by the consortium - particularly those useful in non-academic careers)   

%The doctoral program will have a set of compulsory modules but also some degree of freedom for the 
%ESRs' preferences. ESRs are expected to complete 1 or 2 
%secondments, considered as a part of their training. 

\noindent \color{blue}Network-wide events: schools, yearly meetings and schools. \color{black}

Network-wide schools, conferences and events shown in the table below will be organized by \acronym beneficiaries and partners as part of the training and dissemination program. 
We expect ESRs to attend network events in person, but wherever possible will make network school, conferences and events available as Webinars using the \href{http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/services/fe/vidyo}{Vidyo technology provided by \cernentity}, to allow all \acronym ESRs and PIs to attend if family/personal commitments would otherwise prevent it. 
A permanent record of the lectures will be available as proceedings and in some cases video recordings. 
\acronym has the ambition to continue the training program beyond this Action,

organizing these topical schools in a three-year rotation period. All network-organized schools will be also open to the local students of the beneficiary and partners organizing the school
as part of enhancing the overall training program of the institutions involved in \acronym.
In addition to network-specific events, ESRs will be encouraged to attend the International School of Trigger And Data AcQuisition, (ISOTDAQ) as part of their training plan. 
ISOTDAQ is a yearly school dedicated to triggering and acquiring data for physics experiments with lectures and hands-on exercises in equal proportions. 
The school organizers have agreed that editions of this school from 2020 will feature a lecture on RTA taught by \acronym researchers if the network is funded. 

\noindent \color{blue}Local training. \color{black}
Training events organized specifically for \acronym are complemented by local training provided by beneficiary nodes, as detailed in the table below. 
Students from the network will be able to participate in this training when located at the node. 
All nodes include a range of graduate level courses in languages, career management, presentational skills, diversity and inclusion, as  well as pedagogical courses in teaching and learning that the ESRs will be encouraged to follow to obtain the necessary amount of credits. 
As we want to prepare ESRs to teach others, specific credits are assigned to teaching skills (taking pedagogical courses, but also supervising Master's students). 
Partners will also contribute with individual supervision and local training for employees while students are seconded at their premises.

\noindent \color{blue}\acronym credits system: \color{black}
To ensure that such a diverse training program is coherent and recognized across the network, we have designed  a \acronym credit system according to the ECTS standard. 
%The training side of the projects will be developed as a doctoral program.
Each ESR will complete 180 \acronym\ credits, as shown for an example ESR with two secondments in Table~\ref{tab:docProg}.

As PhDs in all participating institutions are awarded based on local regulations, \acronym credits also ensure that ESRs receive the appropriate training. 
Each network-wide event below includes the amount of assigned \acronym\ credits.

We have assigned 1 \acronym\ credit per each $1/2$ day of lectures. 
All students will have to explicitly include 15 credits of transferrable skills training within their PCDP - they will be able to choose among the programs of their local institute, or the institutes / industries they are seconded in.

around $1/2$ of the \acronym\ credits that they will need to complete in both ``Technical and Research'' and ``Transferable Skills'' categories, as presented at the beginning of the section, will be provided in network-wide events. 
ESRs will have freedom how to complete the rest of required credits through the local resources. 
Finally, ESRs will be required to present their work to at least one conference outside the network in their area of expertise. 
A list of conferences of interest for \acronym topics is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:dissemination}.
The amount of credits awarded will depend on the targeted conference.  
The attribution of ECTS credits will require institutes to explicitly include the network events in their course plan, but the conversion from \acronym to ECTS credits will be justified and straight forward.

                Table~\ref{tab:YearlyMeeting}. 
                The splitting in the length of these meetings refers to the days devoted to ESRs presentations and to lectures.
                Each yearly meeting will contain appropriate dissemination activities
                tailored to local circumstances like public poster sessions,
                lectures, Q\&A sessions or Masterclasses. These will generally take up
                between half a day and one day. 
                All yearly meetings will also include a dedicated half-day of lectures on gender, diversity and inclusion and transferrable skills
                including skills needed to work in their environment positively and effectively (soft skills)
                so that all ESRs have network training that complements their local training. 
                Example topics that have been agreed upon are "Optimizing workspaces for productivity" (\dqentity); 
                "Writing software in collaborative environments" (\wildtreeentity), "Gender and inclusion" (\lundentity),

\subsubsection{Role of non-academic sector in the training program}

\acronym recognizes that basic research is at the heart of its PhD projects in the ESRs, but also that modern academia is not a career for life: researchers can move between academic, industrial,
and entrepreneurial sectors dynamically. 
This enriches all sectors through the transfer of best practice, knowledge, and expertise.
For this reason we have included a comprehensive program of non-academic training in \acronym  including hands-on experience in solving practical problems during secondments
at industrial partners, discussed further in Sec.~\ref{sec:qualityInteraction}.
The non--academic partners of \acronym will have the following crucial roles in the training of the ESRs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Training through research: secondments}. One of \acronym's most important objectives is to increase the exposure of the students to the private sector, solving practical problems with RTA and creating commercial value. 
Most ESRs will have secondments at private companies relevant for their tools and research topics.
These will place a particular emphasis on common methods between the commercial applications which the non--academic partners specialize in, and the academic goals of the ESR projects. 
The connections are emphasized in the ESR project descriptions (Sec.~\ref{sec:FellowProj}). 
\item \textbf{Training through mentoring and supervision:} The secondment supervisor will be a co-supervisor for the overall PhD project, while ESRs that don't have an industrial secondment will be assigned a non--academic tutor throughout their PhD.
\item \textbf{Training through courses: transferrable skills} All industrial beneficiaries and partners have also agreed to provide lectures and courses on transferrable skills and on their experience in occasion of the yearly meetings, and in the network-organized industry school. 
%Since an additional goal of \acronym is to develop sustainable software that is commonplace in industry, dedicated lectures will be given in the introductory school.
\end{itemize}

%allowing the seconded students to participate in their local training events. 
%
%We profit from the experience of the companies that take part in the project, and include secondments with them
%for most of the ESRs
%based at academic nodes. The secondments will be an essential contribution of the non--academic sector to the 
%training, also because 
%The secondments will ensure that ESRs are trained in a variety of skills throughout their participation in \acronym. 
%The industrial beneficiaries and partners in \acronym all share the challenge of high energy physics research
%of taking decisions fast and efficiently, and the secondments are naturally embedded in the research programs
%for each ESR as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:coherence} providing \textbf{training through research}. 
%  
%
%
%Finally, the non--academic sector is also expected to contribute intensely to the network-wide 
%events, both in the Technical/Research and Transferable Skills sides. 
%There will be several lectures on industry-related 
%Transferable Skills covered by experts from the non-academic sector.

% Consider the consequences for the Gantt chart


%ESRs will be trained during the network-wide events
%and in addition receive one-to-one mentoring and supervision specific to their projects,
%as described in Tab.~\ref{tab:LocalTraining}. 
%All ESRs will work on an industrial project relevant
%to their research and deliverables during these secondments. 
%The precise topics will be defined in the PCDPs,
%to give the ESRs some freedom to follow their interests. %Some example topics are

%Below: TBC, but it looks like it's in
%\technopolis will play a key role in this area because
%of their unparalleled experience with training scientists to address policy makers and commercialize
%the results of their research.
%We are particularly aware of the very different ways that job applications work inside
%and outside academia, and this will be addressed directly, both in the lectures and as part of the
%final industry school which all ESRs will attend.

%Examples are: preparation for recruitment and interviews, management, and transitioning
%from academia to industry.

%%4.1 Research and Training Activities
%%Applicants will primarily propose a dedicated and high-level joint research training program that focuses on promoting scientific excellence and exploiting the specific research expertise and infrastructure of the beneficiaries and of the collective expertise of the network as a whole. These training programs will address in particular the development and broadening of the research competences of the ESRs. Such training activities might include:
%% Training through research by means of individual, personalised projects, including meaningful exposure to different sectors;
%% Development of network-wide training activities (e.g. workshops, summer schools) that exploit the inter/multi-disciplinary and intersectoral aspects of the project and expose the researchers to different schools of thought. Such events could also be open to external researchers. For doctoral programs (i.e. EID and EJD), the broad structure of the curriculum should be outlined and preferably quantifiable by ECTS points;
%% Provision of structured training courses (e.g. tutorials, lectures) that are available either locally or at another participant. Training programs between the participants are expected to be coordinated to maximise added value (e.g. joint syllabus development, opening up of local training to other network teams, joint PhD programs, etc.);
%% Exchanging knowledge with the members of the network through undertaking intersectoral visits and secondments. A strong networking component is expected in each proposal;
%% Invitation of visiting researchers originating from the academic or non- academic sector. This would be aimed at improving the skills and know-how of the researchers and should be duly justified in the context of the training program. The network can cover costs of visiting researchers under the Research, Training and Networking cost category.
%%Further training activities with a particular view to widening the career prospects of the researchers would include transferable skills training both within and outside the network. Topics of interest could include:
%%Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, Guide for Applicants Innovative Training Networks 2016
%%Page 15 of 48
%% Training related to research and innovation: management of IPR, take up and exploitation of research results, communication, standardisation, ethics, scientific writing, personal development, team skills, multicultural awareness, gender issues, research integrity, etc.
%% Training related to management or grant searching: involvement in the organisation of network activities, entrepreneurship, management, proposal writing, enterprise start-up, task co-ordination, etc.
%%Each researcher recruited for a period of more than 6 months will establish, together with her/his personal supervisor(s) in the host organisation/s, a personal Career Development Plan. This plan shall aid in the provision of the research training program that best suits the researcher's needs. Attention should be paid to the quality of the joint research training program, with provision for supervision and mentoring arrangements and career guidance. Furthermore, the meaningful exposure of each researcher to other disciplines and sectors represented in the network through visits, secondments and other training events shall also be ensured.
%%Although mutual recognition is mandatory only for EJD, it is expected that both beneficiaries and partner organisations will mutually recognise the quality of the research and training and, if possible, of diplomas and other certificates awarded. The size of the joint research training program and of the network will depend on the nature and scope of the training activities to be undertaken by the network, as well as on considerations regarding management and effective interaction among the partners.
