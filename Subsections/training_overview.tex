The training program of \acronym has three main {\bf objectives}, taking the Salzburg Principles\footnote{Salzburg II recommendations \href{http://www.eua.be/Libraries/publications-homepage-list/Salzburg_II_Recommendations}{webpage}} as a guidance: 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Objective A}: provide ESRs with knowledge and training to conduct original research during and beyond their PhD studies;
\item {\bf Objective B}: provide solid bases in a broad spectrum of topics related to their field of research, extending beyond their dedicated research and including soft skills; 
\item {\bf Objective C}: provide up-to-date and career-related training through interactions with multiple collaborators within academia as well as the industry, to meet the needs of a broad employment market.
\end{itemize}

%MLD what does 'career-focused aspects' supposed to mean?
Objectives A and B will be fulfilled by schools, workshops and events organized within the network; ESRs will profit from high quality lectures delivered by experts within the institutes associated to \acronym, complemented by doctoral training at local nodes. Objective C will be fulfilled by mentoring by senior scientists and special network events where the industrial collaborators will provide seminars and training on commercial applications of \acronym's objectives. All these objectives will be further addressed via the natural collaboration between the ESRs and the various institutes of the network, as well as the planned secondments in academia and industry. This is a more flexible and diverse structure compared to standard PhD studies and will allow the ESRs to develop an individual and unique research mindset within an inclusive environment, so that they can act as proactive participants in furthering HEP and industry goals through RTA techniques.

%(including network-wide training events and complementarity with those programs offered locally at the participating organisations (please include table 1.2a and table 1.2b)

%MLD be consistent with the use of names, some times the responsible is named, other times not
Training is at the heart of all activities within \acronym, with a dedicated Work Package, WP2. All ESRs that will be recruited will obtain a PhD, have a Personal Career Development Plan (PCDP) outlining the training through research, secondment and lectures at the local and host nodes that includes transferrable skills training, and they will be able to attend complementary network-wide training. Their training will be accounted through a credit system designed for this ETN. 

The recruiting deliverables, the composition of the Supervisory Committee (SC) for each ESR and the expertise and qualification of supervisors is shown in Tab. 1.2.

\input{Subsections/RecruitmentDeliverablesTable.tex}

\noindent \color{blue}Recruitment deliverables per participant and awarding of PhD degrees. \color{black}
ESRs will be recruited by month 8, complete a total of 36 months of research and training, and be awarded a PhD degree. 
ESRs at non-academic beneficiaries and ESRs at international or national laboratories will be awarded PhDs by universities within the network and have supervisors in that university as well. 
Each ESR will have a Supervisory Committee (SC) composed of participants from the local and secondment academic and industrial nodes. 
For Finland, Netherlands and Sweden which mandate a four-year PhD, all beneficiaries will provide support for the ESRs to complete their PhD thesis.
%we include a letter of commitment from \nikhef and \lund guaranteeing funding for the final year of the ESR's studies.

%%%PCDP 
\noindent \color{blue}Personal Career Development Plan. \color{black}
Two months after the start of their projects, ESRs and their SC will present a \textbf{Personal Career Development Plan} (PCDP) so that the \textbf{core, advanced and transferrable skills} to be acquired, as well as the milestones for each of the ESR projects, can be agreed between student and supervisor and consortium, planned and monitored throughout the course of the program, taking into account the existing resources both at the ESR node and at foreseen secondments. The PCDP will be reviewed by the local node coordinator, who will bring it to the Supervisory Board (SB) for approval. The main supervisor will be available throughout the course of the PhD, and meet with the ESR on a weekly basis and with an open-door policy, while the SC will meet monthly and on demand. 
%this is written
The local node coordinator will also review the progress described in the PCDP at least every six months (e.g. during staff appraisal meetings) and bring a short report to the consortium. 
%ESRs are expected to participate in one or two network-organized schools throughout
%their PhD, corresponding to up to 3 ECTS each, and one external summer or winter school. 
The PCDP\footnote{The \acronym PCDP will follow a common template based on that from the MSCA website to be coherent between the ESRs.} will include the requirements, milestones and goals within the schedule of the doctoral program (including secondments), the local and network-wide courses and schools to be attended, and a list of dissemination, communication and outreach activities. 
%	requirements and goals of the planned training for the ESR
%	A list of courses (local and network-wide) to be taken by the ESR during their program, including any ECTS credit requirements

%	A schedule for their program, including secondments

%Core Research Skills (acquired via their ESR project)
%Advanced/Additional Research Skills (delivered by the consortium)
%Transferable Skills (delivered by the consortium - particularly those useful in non-academic careers)   

%The doctoral program will have a set of compulsory modules but also some degree of freedom for the 
%ESRs' preferences. ESRs are expected to complete 1 or 2 
%secondments, considered as a part of their training.

Network-wide schools, conferences and events shown in the table below will be organized by \acronym beneficiaries and partners as part of the training and dissemination program and its preparation. 
We expect ESRs to attend network events in person, but wherever possible will make network school, conferences and events available as Webinars using the \href{http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/services/fe/vidyo}{Vidyo technology provided by \cernentity}, to allow all \acronym ESRs and PIs to attend if family/personal commitments would otherwise prevent it. 
A permanent record of the lectures will be available as proceedings, and in some cases video recordings, as \acronym has the ambition to make the training program available beyond this Action and continue organizing successful schools. 
The table below summarizes all events included within the network, with compulsory schools marked in bold so that students attend a yearly meeting and a school each year, dedicating sufficient time to local training and research. 
The hosts and lecturers for these events schools have been identified within the network based on their expertise, see Sec. B1.4.1.

%The training side of the projects will be developed as a doctoral program.
Each ESR will complete 180 \acronym\ credits, as shown for an example
ESR with two secondments in Table~1.4. %\ref{tab:docProg}.
As PhDs in all participating institutions are awarded based on local regulations, \acronym credits also ensure that ESRs receive the appropriate training. 
Each network-wide event below includes the amount of assigned \acronym\ credits.

We have assigned 1 \acronym\ credit per each $1/2$ day of lectures. 
All students will have to explicitly include 15 credits of transferrable skills training within their PCDP. 
% - they will be able to choose among the programs of their local institute, or the institutes / industries they are seconded in. 
By attending the yearly meetings of the network and the final conference, around $1/2$ of the \acronym\ credits that they will need to complete in both ``Technical and Research'' and ``Transferable Skills'' categories, as presented at the beginning of the section, will be provided in network-wide events. 
ESRs will have freedom how to complete the rest of required credits through the local resources. 
Finally, ESRs will be required to present their work to at least one conference outside the network in their area of expertise. 
A list of conferences of interest for \acronym topics is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:dissemination}.
The amount of credits awarded will depend on the targeted conference.  
The attribution of ECTS credits will require institutes to explicitly include the network events in their course plan, but the conversion from \acronym to ECTS credits will be justified and straightforward.

\subsubsection{Role of non-academic sector in the training program}
%MLD I think this sentence is way too hard. Not everyone will agree to this!
%Basic research is at the heart of its PhD projects in the ESRs, but 
\acronym dynamically and directly addresses the challenges of the academic, industrial, and entrepreneurial sectors. 
This enriches all sectors through the transfer of best practices, knowledge, and expertise.
For this reason \acronym includes a comprehensive program of non-academic training, with hands-on experience in solving practical problems during secondments at industrial partners, discussed further in Sec.~\ref{sec:qualityInteraction}.
The non--academic partners of \acronym will have the following roles in the training of the ESRs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Training through research: secondments}. One of \acronym's most important objectives is to increase the exposure of the students to the private sector, solving practical problems with RTA and creating commercial value. 
Most ESRs will have secondments at private companies relevant for their tools and research topics.
These will place a particular emphasis on common methods between the commercial applications which the non--academic partners specialize in, and the academic goals of the ESR projects. 
The connections are emphasized in the ESR project descriptions (Sec.~\ref{sec:FellowProj}). 
\item \textbf{Training through mentoring and supervision:} Industrial secondment supervisors are part of the SB for the overall PhD project. Only three out of 15 ESRs don't have an industrial secondment. To ensure that they are also exposed to non-academic environment they will be assigned a non--academic mentor throughout their PhD.
\item \textbf{Training through lectures: } All industrial beneficiaries and partners have also agreed to provide lectures and courses on transferrable skills and on their experience in occasion of the yearly meetings, in the non-academic training workshop and in the industry school. In particular, participants from \lightboxentity, \pointeightentity and \fleetmaticsentity have an academic background, participants from \uniboentity transitioned from industry back to academia, and participants from \ximantisentity have a start-up in parallel to their academic position. This places the consortium in the best position to prepare the ESRs for a fluid career in academia and industry. 
%Since an additional goal of \acronym is to develop sustainable software that is commonplace in industry, dedicated lectures will be given in the introductory school.
\end{itemize}

%allowing the seconded students to participate in their local training events. 
%
%We profit from the experience of the companies that take part in the project, and include secondments with them
%for most of the ESRs
%based at academic nodes. The secondments will be an essential contribution of the non--academic sector to the 
%training, also because 
%The secondments will ensure that ESRs are trained in a variety of skills throughout their participation in \acronym. 
%The industrial beneficiaries and partners in \acronym all share the challenge of high energy physics research
%of taking decisions fast and efficiently, and the secondments are naturally embedded in the research programs
%for each ESR as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:coherence} providing \textbf{training through research}. 
%  
%
%
%Finally, the non--academic sector is also expected to contribute intensely to the network-wide 
%events, both in the Technical/Research and Transferable Skills sides. 
%There will be several lectures on industry-related 
%Transferable Skills covered by experts from the non-academic sector.

%ESRs will be trained during the network-wide events
%and in addition receive one-to-one mentoring and supervision specific to their projects,
%as described in Tab.~\ref{tab:LocalTraining}. 
%All ESRs will work on an industrial project relevant
%to their research and deliverables during these secondments.

%\technopolis will play a key role in this area because
%of their unparalleled experience with training scientists to address policy makers and commercialize
%the results of their research.
%We are particularly aware of the very different ways that job applications work inside
%and outside academia, and this will be addressed directly, both in the lectures and as part of the
%final industry school which all ESRs will attend.

%Examples are: preparation for recruitment and interviews, management, and transitioning
%from academia to industry.

%%4.1 Research and Training Activities
%%Applicants will primarily propose a dedicated and high-level joint research training program that focuses on promoting scientific excellence and exploiting the specific research expertise and infrastructure of the beneficiaries and of the collective expertise of the network as a whole. These training programs will address in particular the development and broadening of the research competences of the ESRs. Such training activities might include:
%% Training through research by means of individual, personalised projects, including meaningful exposure to different sectors;
%% Development of network-wide training activities (e.g. workshops, summer schools) that exploit the inter/multi-disciplinary and intersectoral aspects of the project and expose the researchers to different schools of thought. Such events could also be open to external researchers. For doctoral programs (i.e. EID and EJD), the broad structure of the curriculum should be outlined and preferably quantifiable by ECTS points;
%% Provision of structured training courses (e.g. tutorials, lectures) that are available either locally or at another participant. Training programs between the participants are expected to be coordinated to maximise added value (e.g. joint syllabus development, opening up of local training to other network teams, joint PhD programs, etc.);
%% Exchanging knowledge with the members of the network through undertaking intersectoral visits and secondments. A strong networking component is expected in each proposal;
%% Invitation of visiting researchers originating from the academic or non- academic sector. This would be aimed at improving the skills and know-how of the researchers and should be duly justified in the context of the training program. The network can cover costs of visiting researchers under the Research, Training and Networking cost category.
%%Further training activities with a particular view to widening the career prospects of the researchers would include transferable skills training both within and outside the network. Topics of interest could include:
%%Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, Guide for Applicants Innovative Training Networks 2016
%%Page 15 of 48
%% Training related to research and innovation: management of IPR, take up and exploitation of research results, communication, standardisation, ethics, scientific writing, personal development, team skills, multicultural awareness, gender issues, research integrity, etc.
%% Training related to management or grant searching: involvement in the organisation of network activities, entrepreneurship, management, proposal writing, enterprise start-up, task co-ordination, etc.
%%Each researcher recruited for a period of more than 6 months will establish, together with her/his personal supervisor(s) in the host organisation/s, a personal Career Development Plan. This plan shall aid in the provision of the research training program that best suits the researcher's needs. Attention should be paid to the quality of the joint research training program, with provision for supervision and mentoring arrangements and career guidance. Furthermore, the meaningful exposure of each researcher to other disciplines and sectors represented in the network through visits, secondments and other training events shall also be ensured.
%%Although mutual recognition is mandatory only for EJD, it is expected that both beneficiaries and partner organisations will mutually recognise the quality of the research and training and, if possible, of diplomas and other certificates awarded. The size of the joint research training program and of the network will depend on the nature and scope of the training activities to be undertaken by the network, as well as on considerations regarding management and effective interaction among the partners.
