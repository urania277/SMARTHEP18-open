%\toprule
%\textbf{Detector:}       & device for collecting, processing,\\
%                          & and analyzing data. E.g., the LHCb\\
%                          & experiment, your mobile phone camera,\\
%                          & a Twitter server, etc.\\
%\textbf{Event:}          & the set of characteristics describing the process under study,\\
%                          & for example a collision between two\\
%                          & proton bunches at the LHC, or the traffic \\
%                          & situation at a point in time and space.\\
%\textbf{Reconstruction:} & building information about individual\\
%                          & objects in an event from raw detector signals.\\
%\textbf{Classification:} & inferring the physical nature of an event\\
%                          & based on its properties.\\
%\textbf{Multivariate:}   & an analysis which considers not only\\
%						& individual quantities but also their\\
%						& correlations when classifying an event,\\
%						& also referred to as \textbf{MVA} for short.\\
%\textbf{Deep learning:}  & classification of an event from\\
%                          & the totality of raw reconstructed data,\\ 
%                         & by multi-layer neural networks.\\
%\textbf{Real-time:}      & an analysis with an upper limit computing\\
%                          & time budget.\\
%\textbf{Trigger:}        & a system which performs real-time data\\
%                          & analysis and selects interesting events\\
%                          & or parts thereof for further study.\\
%\textbf{Neural Network:}  & a Neural Network (NN) is a Machine Learning algorithm
%						    designed to recognize patterns and modelled loosely
%						    on the human brain. \\
%\textbf{Deep NN:}  & NN that extracts features
%					 using many cascaded layers. \\								
%\textbf{Adversarial NN:}  & NN that work against each other \\
%							one generating examples and the other classifying them. 
%							The classifying network gets a normal score, while 
%							the generating network is scored when it can create an example	
%							that escapes the classifier, so to make the classifier more 
%							sensitive to non-standard cases. \\	
%\textbf{Time-ordered series:} & TBC. \\
