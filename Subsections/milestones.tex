%Milestones are control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may
%correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to
%begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen,
%corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the
%project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to
%adopt for further development.
%
%Show how you will confirm that the milestone has been attained. Refer to indicators if
%appropriate. For example: a laboratory prototype completed and running flawlessly;
%software released and validated by a user group; field survey complete and data quality
%validated.
