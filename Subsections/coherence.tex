%The connections between the different work packages and the overall \acronym strategy are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:implementation}.
%Cutting-edge techniques in ML and hybrid architectures will be assessed and developed by the ESRs 
%before their application to specific use cases, in order to enable RTA that advance high energy physics, industry and society, 
%to follow with exploitation and dissemination as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:qualityExploitDissemination}. 
%This modus operandi is at the heart of \acronym and ensures the efficiency of its implementation. 

\subsubsection{Work Packages description}\label{sec:WPdescription}

%Earlier text
\acronym WPs have been introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:metho}. 
Most ESRs will work on projects which fall within different research WPs, strengthening
\acronym into a coherent whole.
As is clear from our research methodology %and represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:implementation}, 
Real-Time Analysis is the conceptual and technical challenge which permeates all research work packages 
and motivates the network.

\subsubsection{List of major deliverables}

%A deliverable is a distinct output of the action, meaningful in terms of the action?s overall objectives and constituted by a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software, training, conference, etc. These should be divided into scientific deliverables and management, training, recruitment and dissemination deliverables. Scientific deliverables have technical/scientific content specific to the action. The number of deliverables in a given Work Package must be reasonable and commensurate with the Work Package content. Note that during implementation, the submission of these deliverables to the REA will be a contractual obligation.
%Table 3.1.b, Including the awarding of doctoral degrees!
