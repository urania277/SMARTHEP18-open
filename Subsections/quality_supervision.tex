%The following section of the European Charter for Researchers refers specifically to supervision:
%
%Employers and/or funders should ensure that a person is clearly identified to
%whom Early-Stage Researchers can refer for the performance of their
%professional duties, and should inform the researchers accordingly.
%Such arrangements should clearly define that the proposed supervisors are
%sufficiently expert in supervising research, have the time, knowledge,
%experience, expertise and commitment to be able to offer the research trainee
%appropriate support and provide for the necessary progress and review
%procedures, as well as the necessary feedback mechanisms.

%The network structure including the strong DS nodes at CNRS/LRI as
%well as the forefront of HEP research institutes (CERN, Lund, RHUL, 
%NIKHEF, Dortmund, CNRS/LAL) ensures that \acronym will be a truly 
%strategic partnership of experts in DS and HEP. 

%This partnership will be
%further strengthened by the strength of the DS experience at
%the chosen partners \nyu and \yandex. 
%The physics students will all be seconded by data
%scientists, allowing them a more stringent theoretical training on
%methods like deep learning. On the other hand, all DS 
%students will be seconded by particle physicists giving them access to
%the the data of the LHC and to actual problems physicists are working
%to solve with DS methods.


%Required sub-headings:
\subsubsection{Qualifications and supervision experience of supervisors}
\label{subsub:qual_supervisors}

%To avoid duplication, the role and profile of the supervisors should only be listed
%in the "Capacity of the Participating Organisations" tables (see section 5 below)

The ESRs at \acronym\ will be supervised by a group of competent
researchers with proven experience in supervising PhD and Master's theses. 
The consortium gathers the main experts in in RTA, machine learning and hybrid architectures from
all LHC collaborations, with a demonstrated track record. 
More than half of the ESRs will have a female supervisor, 
which is more than the norm in the field and should set an example of gender balance to follow
throughout the ESR's career. 

The names of the supervisors for each ESR, together with the number of
theses supervised to date in square brackets,
are provided in Table~\cite{tab:recruitmentDeliverables}.
The main supervisor is listed in boldface. 
The academic and industrial partners play a key role in 
supervision of \acronym, 
with the secondment responsibles acting as secondary supervisors. 
In the cases where an industrial secondment is not present, the ESRs have a supervisor from an industrial partner
for mentoring and career advice purposes. 
Supervisors / tutors from industrial partners
are listed in italics. 

%In all cases, the supervisors chosen for each ESR are those with the most relevant experience and expertise to
%enhance both the research and training potential of the ESR project. The same logic has guided the selection
%of secondments for each ESR.

%%WP3
All ESRs will have a component of HEP real-time data analysis. 
Gligorov and Albrecht hold ERC grants on real-time physics analysis on the LHCb collaboration and have served in
multiple senior coordinating roles on the experiment. 
%and on the first triggerless detector readout. 
Their expertise is complemented by Raven from \nikhefentity, former LHCb HLT project leader and one of
the main authors of LHCb trigger software over the last decade, by further software experience from Matev from \cernentity
and by the expertise in ML training
by LHCb researcher Ustyuzhanin from the Yandex School of Computing and \cernentity.   
Doglioni from (\lundentity, ERC StG), Boveia (\ohioentity),  Starovoitov and
Dunford in (\heidelbergentity) are the pioneers of the first trigger-level search for new physics in the
ATLAS collaboration. Together with the trigger and physics experts Strom and Majewski (\oregonentity), 
Petersen (\cern), Sfyrla (\unigeentity), Igonkina (\nikhefentity), with the computing grid and data analysis expert 
Smirnova (\lundentity) and with the machine learning expert Schramm (\unigeentity), 
they represent a team that can guide the ESRs to design analyses targeting discoveries and
advance high energy physics with novel techniques. 
The same can be said of the CMS researchers, M. Voutilainen, P. Eerola and H. Kirschenmann (\helsinkientity)
and M. Pierini (\cernentity, ERC CoG on Machine Learning at the LHC), who have designed and 
published the first search for new particles in CMS using trigger objects. P. Christiansen at \lundentity
and R. Shahoyan from \cernentity complement the data analysis in real-time from the ALICE collaboration,
attempting the first physics measurement with readout at the LHC collision rate for their Time Projection Chamber. 
%
%%WP4
For ESRs on hybrid architectures (3, 4, 8-11, 15), the help of
Lacassagne from \sorbonneentity, leader of the Hardware and Software for Embedded Systems team at LIP6 and
coordinator of WP6, will be crucial for a coherent program of studies. 
The know-how of Annovi and Roda from \pisaentity, Boveia of \ohioentity, and Crescioli of \cnrsentity in FPGA design
and commissioning from their experience on the ATLAS FTK, provide training and research 
using one of the first hybrid supercomputers in HEP as testing ground. 
GPU expertise is provided by Santos of \santiagoentity,
also holding an ERC StG on applications of GPUs for HEP. 
%
%%WP5
All ESRs except the most architecture-oriented ESR10 will perform a search or a measurement. Those
working on Dark Sectors and physics beyond the SM will benefit from the knowledge of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group organizers, 
Boveia and Doglioni, as well as from the expertise of in supersymmetric dark matter and new physics searches of Petersen, Sfyrla, 
Majewski, Voutilainen and Dunford. The network expertise in LFV/LFU is given by Albrecht, Gligorov, Teubert (\cernentity), Raven and Igonkina. 
Eerola of \helsinkientity is an expert of b-physics measurements,
and Malaescu of \cnrsentity is currently the ATLAS Standard Model convener, while Christiansen holds
several national grants for measurements in ALICE. 
%
%%WP6
Supervision towards commercial problems and solutions that complement the HEP component of the ESRs research projects 
are provided by all industrial nodes, with Sambo (\fleetmaticsentity), Catastini (\lightboxentity), Sopasakis (\ximantisentity), Head (\wildtreeentity),
Hindlzich (\cathientity) and Kaplan (\heidelberginstrumentsentity), Meric (\dqentity) and Julli\'{e} (\ibmentity). Head, Meric, Sambo and Catastini transitioned to
industry after a successful research experience in HEP, while Sopasakis is the CEO of a start-up alongside his
assistant professorship at \lundentity, so they are well placed to supervise and mentor students with intersector projects and career perspectives. 
%

%The expertise and the most relevant qualifications of the supervisors are in the table, with full 
%details in Sec.~\ref{sec:capacities}. 

% and will be the main
%mentor for the ESR on career and intellectual development. The main supervisor will also be responsible
%for helping the ESR compile their PCDP, discussed in the previous section.

All supervisors will direct the research and training of the ESRs and work together on the topic
of RTA. They will also assist the ESRs during the course of \acronym:
this includes providing help with travel, installation, accommodation, integration, etc., 
with the help of the dedicated secondment officer, Dr. O. Smirnova. The supervisors 
will also provide mentoring and support towards the ESR's future career. 
The ESRs will also receive informal mentoring by the high profile experienced scientists
located at the various nodes that have agreed to participate in the Supervisory Board
(see Sec.~\ref{sub:jointGoverningStructure}). 

\vskip-10pt

\subsubsection{Quality of the joint supervision arrangements}
\label{sec:jointsuperqual}

%To do if there is more room: explain better why a given supervisor is the best co-supervisor for a given project. 

%Justification for these choices can be found in the individual ESR descriptions. 
As shown in Table in Sec.~\ref{tab:recruitmentDeliverables},
each ESR will be assigned one or two \textbf{main supervisors}\footnote{Two main supervisors
are foreseen when the student is receiving their PhD by a university different from the beneficiary.},
alongside one or more \textbf{second supervisors}. 
%In  case the node granting the PhD title is not the same as the host,
%one or two of the supervisors will be from the host and another one or two from the second institution.
During the secondments, all the ESRs will have a responsible \textbf{tutor} in
the institution in which the secondment is taking place. These tutors
will ensure that the internship is fruitful for the research project
of the student and for their training, and will provide all the necessary
resources. 
%All members of the node to which the ESR is seconded will participate in training. and be available to the ESRs throughout their secondments.
We have also taken care to place the secondment in 
the same location or country wherever possible, to ensure an effective joint supervision 
with maximal cross-talk, and that the overhead of ESRs moving countries (especially those with family) is reduced. 
%In this way the benefit of the secondment to the ESRs will be maximized.

As described in the previous section (Sec.~\ref{sec:training}), the ESRs and the supervisors
will create a PCDP. Supervisors and ESRs will meet at least weekly, to review the work done and agree on next steps. 
Whenever the students are on a secondment, this meeting will be with the tutors, and the supervisors
will have the chance to join via Skype. 
%Supervisors 
%who are not in the same physical location of the ESR (either because they are from a different 
%institution or because the student is on a secondment) will join these meetings via 
%teleconference. 
A "virtual corridor" for efficient communication between
students and remote supervisors will be created in the form of 
instant messaging channels on the Mattermost platform for those who wish to use it,
as described in Sec.~\ref{sub:networkOrganization}. 
The supervisors will report on the progress to the WP responsibles
at the Executive Board meetings (see Sec.~\ref{sub:jointGoverningStructure}). 

As research organizations, neither \cernentity, nor \nikhefentity award
Doctoral degrees, and neither do the private
sector beneficiaries, \dqentity and \ibmentity. ESRs are enrolled in partner
universities of the network, mainly where the beneficiary members 
hold positions, are assigned co-supervisors from the partner university,
and obtain their PhD degree there. 

%In the case of \cnrsentity, node members also
%hold positions at \sorboneeentity, and
%the ESRs will be enrolled in this university to obtain
%their Doctoral degrees. Similar arrangements exist between 
%\nikhefentity 
%and its partner universities, \amsterdamentity and \radboudentity.
%In the case of \cernentity, the ESRs
%are assigned co-supervisors from \unigeentity and \dortmundentity, 
%and will be awarded PhD degrees in the same manner as ESRs based at these institutions. 



%Because \dqentity is based in Paris, no specific secondments to the academic
%supervisors between \dqentity and \parisUentity are foreseen, and the 
%$students will be able to alternate working between the nodes as best fits the research and training goals.

%Each ESR will, together with their supervisor, create a PCDP. 
%This will include the scientific contents 
%of the research project that the ESR will carry out and the
%list of their secondments and foreseen work. 
%The PCDP will contain a list of objectives for the 
%student. The PCDP will be presented by the ESR six months after
%the starting of their project to 
%be approved first by the local node coordinator, then by the
%relevant WP coordinator, and finally by 
%the Consortium Supervision Board. Updates to the PCDP,
%depending upon the outcome of some of the WP 
%milestones, will be allowed provided they are agreed
%with the specific WP coordinator. By the end of 
%their project, the ESR will be asked to present a report in
%which they compare the final 
%result of their work to the initial objectives. 
%This report will also have to be approved by the 
%relevant WP coordinators.
