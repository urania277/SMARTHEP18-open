The main academic results of \acronym are the toolkits and review
papers. Open-access versions of the toolkits will be released 
as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ipr}, 
and furthermore exploited in the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb collaborations.% as
%described in deliverables XX and YY.
We will actively encourage the wider exploitation of these toolkits
through our dissemination strategy.% facilitated 
%by the commitment to \textbf{sustainable software} at the core of our
%research methodology. 

As mentioned in the previous section, the physics publications produced within
the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb collaborations fall under the CERN regulations on intellectual
property. Similar terms apply to the data and software tools generated within
the academic institutions and the CERN laboratory. \acronym will
conform to the open access policies of the four LHC collaborations
when it comes to the data collected by these detectors. 
This software will be distributed under Open Source licenses, such
as BSD or GPL, ensuring free usage and distribution. An exception
applies to results produced by ESRs working in the private
companies. In this case the internal rules of the  companies
concerning the Intellectual Property of the work need to be respected
to guarantee its potential commercial  exploitation.
Preliminary arrangements with the concerned companies have been made,
so that the obtained development are published in journal papers,
while their actual implementation remains the Intellectual Property of
the company. More details of IPR can be found in Sec.~\ref{sec:ipr}.

The main commercial results of \acronym are the 
improved \ximantis traffic prediction application,
implementation of \tensorflow on mobile platforms,
toolkit for generation of adversarial neural network examples,
software for real-time anomaly detection through automated inference, and
Internet-of-Things sensors for industrial production processes. 
Beneficiary institutes and secondment hosts will both benefit from
the exploitations in joint intellectual property agreements. 

Some industrial beneficiaries and partners have carried
out preliminary benefit analyses of these results,
based on their revenues and margins from current products.
%For the toolkit developed by ESRZ, 
%the overall life insurance market is worth
%around \euro1.7 trillion while the deep learning products are
%estimated to be worth billions of Euro.  
\dq estimates that
the successful completion of deliverable 2.3 will lead to better
prediction of risk and hence reduced insurance costs. \dq estimates 
this will lead to generated economic value of O(2)~MEuro per year. 
%\dq will retain the right to commercially exploit the results, other
%consortium members will retain fair-use rights, and simplified
%proof-of-principle products will be made available
%under Open Access in order to facilitate further innovation and
%development stemming from those. 
The adoption of predictive maintenance in industrial production processes
thanks to the  Internet-of-Things sensors development during the \lightbox secondment, 
is estimated to on average reduce maintenance costs by more than 25\%, reduce breakdowns by more
than 70\%, reduce downtime by more than 35\% and increase productivity
by more than 20\%. 
Finally, while we cannot quantify all industrial products in the same way,
we are convinced that the other secondment projects which the
ESRs will perform with their industrial partners, and the innovation of methods which
\acronym will more generally foster, will lead to significant additional economic value.

We have preliminarily reserved 15000 EUR 
from the management budget~\footnote{Quote as per discussion
with LU Innovation, for filing first a national and then an 
international patent} for filing a possible patent on one of these
commercial deliverables, to boost the exploitation of the most promising algorithms
and toolkits in \acronym. The use of this fund for patent filing
will have to be approved unanimously by the Supervisory Board.
