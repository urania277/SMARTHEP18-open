%- Make sure that partner organizations are involved e.g. contribute to network-wide training, local training, secondments, other...
%- Role of external contributors, e.g. Visiting Scientists
%- Role of non-academic sector

The training program and assignment of the network events has been planned according to the research and industrial expertise of the various nodes.
The training component of the network is led by \unigeentity in WP2, with contributions from all beneficiaries and partners outlined in Sec.~\ref{sub:overviewTraining}.  

%training through research/secondments
Training through research in RTA techniques is the focal point of the network. 
ESRs will learn to use cutting-edge tools and techniques on Machine Learning and data analysis (WP3) and hybrid computing architectures (WP4), and use them to apply RTA to decision-making (WP4) as well as to monitoring and discoveries (WP5) in research and industry, during their thesis work and secondments.
Interconnections and complementarities on these topics within \acronym are detailed further in Sec.~\ref{ss:competence_44}. 
All industrial partners and most of the beneficiaries in \acronym will host secondments, see List of Participants and Sec.~\ref{sec:FellowProj}. 

All industrial and academic nodes contribute to the training program with specific courses during the network training events (Table 1.3), local courses and dedicated graduate schools (see Sec.~\ref{sub:overviewTraining}), secondments. \textbf{Introductory ML lectures} will be taught by Sambo (\fleetmaticsentity), Gligorov (\cnrsentity), Pierini (\cernentity); \textbf{trigger and detector reconstruction} lectures will be taught by Raven (\nikhefentity), Strom (\oregonentity) and Christiansen (\lundentity), \textbf{HEP analysis} lectures will be taught by Albrecht (\dortmundentity) and Voutilainen (\helsinkientity), while \textbf{hybrid architecture lectures} will be taught by Lacassagne (\sorbonneentity), Crescioli (\cnrsentity) and Annovi (\pisaentity).
\textbf{Advanced lectures in ML and AI} will be given by professors in ML Ustyuzhanin (Yandex responsible for \cernentity projects) and Louppe (\liegesentity), and Sopasakis (\ximantisentity) for use in industry.

The \textbf{FPGA school} lectures and bootcamp will be taught by Crescioli (\cnrsentity) and Boveia (\cernentity). 
The \textbf{GPU school} lectures and tutorials will be given by Martinez-Santos (\santiagoentity) and Catastini (\lightboxentity). 
All industrial beneficiaries and partners will contribute to the \textbf{Transferrable skills} event joint with the INSIGHTS ITN and to the \textbf{Industry and commercial applications school}. 
At this school, the ESRs will participate in half-day lectures given by each of the partners including: experience from transitioning from physics to industry (Dungs, from LHCb to \pointeightentity) and vice versa (Salti, previously \fleetmaticsentity, now \uniboentity), examples of the life-cycle of a basic commercial strategy offered by \lightboxentity, and group work in analyzing case studies (all industrial partners and beneficiaries). 

All schools and events will include transferrable skills sessions, with example topics of "Getting excellent research ideas" and "Successful grant-writing" by \acronym ERC grantees Pierini, Doglioni, Gligorov, Martinez-Santos and Albrecht. 
The researchers in \acronym will also invite visiting researchers from their existing research networks, e.g. there will be lectures on sustainable and reproducible research by B. Ragan-Kelley from JupyterLab and on FAIR Data by Maria Johnsson, librarian at \lundentity.

%Talk about interconnections of the various ESRS with each other: learning from each other

%The companies participating to the network are outlined in what follows. 
%
%\paragraph{Dreamquark}
%
%As a company founded by a physicist to apply machine learning techniques to real-time commercial data analysis, Dreamquark is an ideal place for ESRs to be trained in both the techniques of fundamental research and in applying those techniques to real world problems. Apart from the explicit training which will be provided, ESRs based or seconded at Dreamquark will also benefit from the atmosphere and culture of a company founded by former scientists, which will benefit them whether they pursue a career in academia or industry later on. 
%
%\paragraph{Lightbox} 
%
%\lightbox is a family office that manages proprietary money by investing in three main areas: 1) financial markets, 2) private equity and 3) real estate. Since inception the company has invested heavily in technology infrastructure and quantitative research to guarantee State-of-the-Art Multi-Asset research development and executions platforms. With respect to financial markets, the investment decisions and processes are fully automated in real-time with minimal human intervention and with ultra-low latency processing and execution capabilities.
%More recently, a sister company called \lightbox was created to apply similar technological infrastructure and quantitative analysis knowhow to companies. \lightbox offers advanced digital consulting services to real-economy businesses such as: big and smart data analytics, data enrichment of structured and unstructured sources, data protection and encryption, predictive and prescriptive data analysis, risk management, real-time complex event processing.
%
%\paragraph{Ximantis} 
%
%\ximantis is a Swedish traffic forecasting company founded in 2014. \ximantis is able to produce forecasts of upcoming traffic congestion in real time thus allowing users to avoid them. Being able to therefore produce detailed traffic evolution at a specific road location and specific future time allows for significant savings in time and energy resources. Given the huge impact of traffic in CO2 emissions and other pollutants the overall environmental benefits provide clear incentives for any city to implement the Ximantis forecasting technology.
%The forecast ability of Ximantis relies on the extensive traffic experience behind the team as well as advanced mathematical innovations. Specifically \ximantis holds a patent on an innovative stochastic process which it couples against a machine learning algorithm in order to produce real time forecasts using a Monte Carlo simulation. The computation takes place on the Amazon Web Servers using both historic as well as real time driver information and can be transmitted to drivers in real time via the \ximantis app as well as to traffic authorities. 
%
%\paragraph{CATHI}
%
%\cathi GmbH is a German company, founded in 2003 with headquarters in Mannheim. From its foundation, \cathi has worked closely with universities and clinics to develop medical simulation products and services. The \cathiSimulator Simulator, which emerged from research, is highly competitive and ranks among the international leaders in this product category. The company is thus consistently taking into account the growing need for simulation of complex medical interventions.
%

%\paragraph{HIMT}
%\heidelberginstrumentslongline is a German company founded in 1984 by researchers from the \heidelberglong   and other institutes with focus on integrated patterning tools for the semiconductor industry. 
%Low-cost chips contain hundreds of millions of transistors. These are made using a  lithography technology. The  semiconductor industry uses optical projection lithography, where a pattern is first created on a  mask at four times the desired final size, and the image of the mask is projected onto a  wafer by a large and very expensive reduction lens.
%In maskless lithography, the radiation that is used to expose a photosensitive emulsion is not projected from, or transmitted through, a photomask. Instead the radiation is focused to a narrow beam. The beam is then used to directly write the image into the photoresist, one or more pixels at a time.
%The direct laser writing is a growing form of optical maskless lithography which offers flexibility, ease of use, and cost effectiveness in wafer processing when working with feature sizes of approximately 500 nm or greater.
%\heidelberginstruments is today a global leader in design, development and manufacturing of complex laser based maskless lithography systems. These systems are critical to fabrication of advanced photomasks and direct write solutions.

\subsubsection{Synergies between participating organisations}
\label{sec:synergy}

Participants in \acronym are \textbf{experts in HEP and industrial real-time data analysis}, so the skills and goals of the network participants are complementary and enhance each other. 

The \acronym network includes a group of HEP researchers who have proven their ability to work and deliver large scale projects together. 
At the LHC, the \dortmundentity, \santiagoentity participants play a key role in the trigger and RTA of the LHCb collaboration, \ohioentity, \pisaentity, \oregonentity in ATLAS, \cnrsentity, \nikhef and \heidelbergentity in ATLAS and LHCb, \lundentity in ATLAS and ALICE, \helsinkientity and \cernentity in CMS.
\cernentity hosts all experimental collaborations and their detectors, providing an ideal ground for common training and events, as well as hands-on experience for the ESRs in physics analysis. 
The participation of the RTA pioneers and experts from all LHC collaborations on common analysis topics is a key feature of this network, and allows to gain the necessary momentum and critical mass to make paradigm-shifting changes in HEP. 
These synergies are already being exploited in obtaining joint funding and co-organizing workshops and events, such as the \href{RAPID workshop}{https://rapid2018.org} and data challenge co-organized by \dortmundentity and \cnrsentity in 2018 on the topics of ML and RTA for detector reconstruction and industry (with Sopasakis from \ximantisentity as a keynote speaker), or the COST action CA16201 on precision HEP \href{https://particleface.eu}{PARTICLEFACE} with involvement of \lundentity and \helsinkientity as Swedish and Finnish contacts. 
\acronym is the perfect opportunity to enhance and extend those collaborations to a wider network with a long-term perspective, bringing advancements beyond the state of the art for RTA at the LHC. 

These advancements require specific expertise from computer science and data processing that goes beyond HEP. 
The non-academic partners have been chosen so that the ESRs can learn hands-on from RTA and and decision making in the topics of transport, finance and IoT, while cross-pollinating industry applications with the skills acquired from the analysis of LHC data. 
Experience in applications of machine learning for RTA is provided by \liegesentity, \uniboentity, \ibmentity, \ximantisentity and \pointeightentity. 
In particular, \ibmentity can contribute to solving one of the key challenges for RTA in both HEP and fraud detection: the need to have understandable and reproducible decision-making processes in real time, using rule induction techniques. 
Real-time sensors and hybrid architectures are a specialty of \lightboxentity and \fleetmaticsentity, in synergy with the expertise of \uniboentity and \sorbonneentity in terms of computing on resource-constrained platforms and edge computing. 
In all those topics, non-academic beneficiaries and partners offer ESRs and HEP researchers the perfect opportunities to exploit ideas and algorithms created for fundamental research in a commercial context, promoting the ESR advancement in both fields and solving challenges that are crucial for both academia and industry.

The non-academic beneficiaries also have more specific connections beyond academia as depicted in Fig. 2 and in the ESR descriptions, so that the industrial partners can benefit from each other's expertise and advance their business. Those connections will be discussed among partners and beneficiaries in topical meetings during the yearly network events. 

%This is empty blurb
%Real-time analysis is the glue of \acronym, but the individual nodes have multiple synergies through their research
%interests and expertise which bind them closer together. 
%The breadth of the physics and industrial problems which the ESRs will address using novel tools will
%stimulate innovation, %thanks to the exposure of academic and industrial research topics to advances in different areas.
%%This cross-pollination of expertises, industrial and research excellence will 
%and ensure that \acronym will be more than just a sum of its parts. 
%More information on the complementarity of the expertise of the individual researchers can be found in Sec.~\ref{sub:composition}.

\subsubsection{Exposure of recruited researchers to different (research) environments, and the complementarity thereof}
\label{sec:exposureComplementarity}

\acronym will expose all ESRs to environments and challenges of HEP and industry. This will create a generation of interdisciplinary problem-solving researchers.
Within their project, ESRs with a computing/hardware background will work on LHC data analysis, and ESRs with a HEP background will work on the techniques and methodologies of data science, software and hardware programming.
All ESRs will be exposed to commercial applications of RTA, by conducting their PhD research in an industry beneficiary, or through secondments to industry, as well as via mentoring and network-wide events. 
%This will broaden their viewpoints and stimulate their creativity through exposure to the different problems and constraints inherent in commercial RTA applications.

%Sure but cut on space
%This should be compared to the current academic state of the art for a physics or DS student: exposure to a supervisor and
%handful of postdocs within their own field, and the possibility to attend one or two international conferences in their own field
%during the course of the doctorate. This is true even for students in large international collaborations at the LHC. 
%We expect that \acronym ESRs will be better equipped to solve
%problems across a wider range of disciplines than most of their peers,
%and that this flexibility will enable them to lead
%the next generation of both research and commercial development.

%In addition we stress that all the members of \acronym will have the possibility to discuss and present their work at world leading 
%research laboratories and be trained at Universities among the highest ranked in the world.
