\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:}
In 2019-2020 the LHC will be shut down to upgrade and prepare the experiments for Run 3. The goal of the ALICE experiment upgrade is to be able to analyse the full rate of events, 50000 events per second, thereby increasing the sensitivity for most measurements by between an order and two orders of magnitude.
The ALICE Lund group with P. Christiansen is involved in both detector upgrades and data analysis. The main goal on the detector side is the upgrade of the TPC with a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) readout that will allow continuous operation. This continuous readout requires a whole new software framework denoted O2 (online-offline). The goal of the O2 framework is to do full calibration and reconstruction in real time (RTA).  
The first objective of ESR14 is to contribute to the development of the  ALICEO2 framework and use this expertise in the analysis of the first data from Run 3, which will start in 2021. The upgraded TPC will have to be calibrated for large distortions due to charge build up. These distortions are of order cm and have to be calibrated with sub-millimeter precision over a space volume of 90 cubic meter. Due to charge fluctuations the calibration maps will have to be updated every 5 milliseconds or so. This demands fast, effective and robust algorithms that ESR14 will have to develop and benchmark.
The second objective of ESR14  is the analysis of heavy-ion data, which will first be available after roughly one year of proton-proton (pp) data. This means that ESR14 will have time to develop the framework during the shutdown (2019-2020) and then validate it with pp data before they will apply it to one of the first heavy ion analyses with the upgraded data. This analysis will be a measurement of the nuclear modification factor [CD to Peter: this needs some layman text], since this measurement will be very sensitive to the corrections and will be the perfect testing ground for the algorithms developed.

\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Expected Results:}
This ESR will lead to two peer-reviewed papers. One will be on the calibration and reconstruction performance of the upgraded TPC (Deliverable~\deliverableHEPPubALICETPC) and one will be on one of the first results of the measurement of the nuclear modification factor in Run 3 (Deliverable~\deliverableHEPPubALICEPhysics). The student connected to this ESR will receive a PhD in HEP at ULUND.
ESR1 will receive a PhD in experimental HEP at \lund.

%In 2019-2020 LHC will be shut down to upgrade and prepare the experiments for Run 3. The goal of the ALICE upgrade is to be able to analyse the full rate of events, 50kHz, online thereby increasing the sensitivity for most measurements by between an order and two orders of magnitude.
%PC is involved in both detector upgrades and data analysis. The main goal on the detector side is the upgrade of the TPC with a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) readout that will allow continuous operation. The continuous readout requires a whole new software framework denoted O2 (online-offline). The goal of the framework is to do full calibration and reconstruction in real time (RTA).  
%The Lund heavy-ion group is since long time active in the ALICE TPC project. Sweden has contributed with around 21MSEK (~2M¤) to the TPC detector. PC is one of two coordinators of ALICE TPC GEM upgrade simulation activities responsible for the implementation of the GEM TPC simulations in the O2 framework.

%Ruben Shahoyan is an expert on software and one of the main developers
%for the ALICE O2 project. He coordinates the ALICE upgrade activity on
%calibration and reconstruction, and has played a critical role in
%calibrating the space point distortions of the existing TPC.

%The Lund heavy-ion group is since long time active in the ALICE Time
%Projection Chamber (TPC) project, which, with its 90 cubic meter gas
%volume and 500,000 readout channels, is the largest TPC in the world.
%Sweden has contributed with around 21MSEK (~2M¤) to the TPC detector
%(~1/3 of the total cost). The Lund group has been heavily involved both
%in the research and development as well as the construction,
%installation and commissioning of the TPC. This has led to a detector
%working well, from the start of data taking in 2009. 
%To enable 50 kHz running, the ALICE TPC will be upgraded with a
%completely new GEM readout for LHC Run 3. The Lund group will develop
%and fabricate the front-end-readout electronics with the main
%collaborator Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Lund has taken on
%the charge to lead the characterization of the front-end chip, SAMPA,
%which is a new development for readout of GEM based TPCs. Lund will
%also contribute to the installation and commissioning on the TPC in
%2019-20.
%At the same time, Peter Christiansen as one of two coordinators of
%ALICE TPC GEM upgrade simulation activities will be responsible for the
%implementation of the GEM TPC simulations in the new O2 software
%framework. This development is coupled to the major challenge on the
%TPC calibration and reconstruction side of the upgrade, where the large
%rates in Run 3 and on will lead to space charge build up in the gas
%volume. The resulting space charge distortions will be of order
%centimeters and have to be calibrated to better than 200 microns to not
%affect the precision of the reconstruction.
