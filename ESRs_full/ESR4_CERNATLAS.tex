}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:}
The computational power boost seen over the last decade in CPUs has come from increasing the number of cores in a single processor rather than the core speed. This makes multi-threaded programming, which divides calculations over multiple cores running in parallel, mandatory for fully exploiting the power of these CPUs. Until recently, however, most HEP code was not able to execute in a multithreaded way.
%Until recently in HEP the multiple cores could be
%utilized fairly efficiently by simply processing a different event on each core (multi-processing), but as the core count has increased this is no longer efficient and instead a more advanced, multi-threaded approach has to be employed. 
Such an approach is particularly challenging for real-time analysis, where the overhead of multi-threaded processing might be large compared to the required speed. The first objective of ESR4 is to implement new monitoring capabilities within the ATLAS real-time code, to measure the algorithm scheduling and performance as well as the overhead of multi-threading. Working on this objective will result in ESR4 becoming trained in advanced techniques of developing and evaluating code for modern highly parallel architectures.
%The first objective of ESR4 is to ensure an highly efficient, parallel, multi-threaded implementation of the ATLAS high-level trigger system by implementing new monitoring capabilities to measure the algorithm scheduling and algorithm performance as well as the overhead of the multi-threaded system. 
This work will be done in synergy with ESR11 and ESR12, conducted in the CERN ATLAS team and integrated in the ATLAS real-time software.%, but it will focus from the start on the ATLAS trigger algorithms with multithreading. 
It will be used to analyze the resource usage and identify improvements that maximize the utilization of concurrent processing.
%The work will be conducted in the CERN ATLAS team and integrated in the ATLAS trigger software group developing the ATLAS multithreaded execution framework. 
Parallelization is also a task required by complex event systems, such as investment strategies,
algorithmic trading infrastructures and integrated business processes. 
However, the evolution of such systems is a sequential process. 
In their secondment at \lightbox, 
ESR4 will study two orthogonal approaches
to improve the efficiency of investment code
running on a multi-core CPU: either splitting the main task into independent sub-tasks requiring limited
synchronization and each running on a single core, or revising its implementation so that fewer cores
are used. The optimization is intended to be applied in real-time during the process. 
ESR4's second task will be to produce a commercial framework containing the figures of merit for the real-time optimization of 
tasks.

%Simulation of complex event systems, like investment strategies, algorithmic trading infrastructures, integrated business processes, require considerable computational power that is hard to obtain from a fully sequential process given the underlying timing constraints. In most scenarios the final user is interested in the outcome of a simulation under potential perturbations or suggested improvements to the controlling algorithms, and rapid feedback is a crucial feature to enhance the effectiveness of decision making processes. On the other hand, the evolution of a complex event system is inherently a sequential process given that, although many activities occur concurrently, the number of necessary synchronizations may hinder the speedup produced by parallelization.
%Our objective is to study two orthogonal approaches to improve the efficiency of a simulation task running on a multi-core CPU. On one hand we aim to separate a simulation task into several independent sub-tasks that require limited synchronization. On the other hand, especially when the number of independent tasks does not cover the total number of available cores, we aim to revise the implementations of our simulators so that the number of synchronization points is reduced at the cost of replicating part of the computation. We plan to identify appropriate measure effectiveness, like for instance the ratio between the time required by a sequential process normalized by the number of cores, and the time required by the multi-threaded process. We plan as well to employ techniques based on competitive ratios to assess how task parallelization can be decided online during the simulation process.
%We expect to start by ad-hoc adaptations of our existing code to a modern multi-core architecture, and use the resulting know-how to identify generic implementation patterns that could be amenable to automatic on-line or off-line optimization.
Parallelization is also a focus of the ATLAS \cnrs group, with ESR8 working on the parallelization of the pattern bank creation for FTK. 
ESR4's third objective will be to apply the knowledge on multi-threading 
gained from the optimization of the ATLAS trigger software to the creation of pattern banks for FTK, and see whether the algorithms
are optimal or can benefit from further improvement. 
ESR4's fourth objective is to use the gained insights and knowledge to implement new real-time analysis
capabilities in the ATLAS trigger system for long-lived particle signatures. For example, long-lived
charged particles can decay in middle of the tracking volume, leaving just a short, straight trajectory of highly
ionizing hits in the innermost layers. These could be identified already in the trigger system with a fast,
dedicated pattern recognition algorithm.
This would increase the trigger acceptance for such particles in ATLAS Run-3 data and the ESR would be
expected to take a lead on such an early data analysis.
This work will be done in collaboration with ESR3 and benefit from the supervision of Dr. A. Sfyrla. 
ESR4 will then apply this algorithm in a search for long-lived particles with the first Run-3 LHC experiment data
collected with the ATLAS experiment, as a fifth and final objective.
