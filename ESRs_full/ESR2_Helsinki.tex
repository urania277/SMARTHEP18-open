}\tabularnewline\hline
\multicolumn{6}{|p{20.2cm}|}{\textbf{\Tstrut Objectives:}
The algorithms to identify heavy object and the presence of heavy quarks (e.g. $b$ quarks) in 
jets based on experimental inputs are a natural playground for "deep" ML and has
been tested in offline jet reconstruction. 
%First steps towards this have been taken in offline reconstruction during Run 2. 
Adopting these developments at the trigger level will significantly improve
the performance of targeted triggers to record more
interesting data for offline analysis and enhance the performance of analyses with
with trigger jets, as they will be able to exploit discrimination variables that
were only accessible offline. The first objective of ESR2 is to understand the
resource cost of such algorithms, and, if feasible, implement them at the trigger level. 
The four-month industrial secondment project to Fleetmatics will have the objective of
adapting Deep Learning frameworks, such as Tensor Flow and Keras,
in a smartphone environment, for real-time processing of images captured by mobile devices. 
The research project will allow Fleetmatics to explore potential business developments
in the mobile domain and would be an instrumental step towards in-vehicle edge computing
applications through mobile phones. 
After the secondment, the student will have stronger expertise in Deep Learning
frameworks in real-time environment, which will also be key to address the physics challenges
in improving flavor identification at the trigger level.
The third objective of ESR2 is to remove the "safety net" of the events that only 
are processed at a later date in case of discovery. If less 
storage is needed for these events (e.g. if only 1\% of them is recorded), 
then the trigger level sevents can have an increased rate. 
This can only be done only once the performance of the objects reconstructed in
real-time is equivalent to offline, and includes the variables in the first objective. 
This generic trigger level dataset will enable a wide range of analyses
to be performed that rely on datasets with hadronic activity. 
A 6-month secondment to CERN will enable the ESR to collaborate closely 
with the world experts in ML and real-time analysis
on the implementation of the flavor identification techniques at the trigger level
and deploying this general purpose scouting stream.  
%such
%as the scalar sum of jet \pT $H_\textrm{T}$ or the leading jet \pT itself, with much lower thresholds than before. 
A testcase for the general purpose trigger level dataset is the analysis of
modestly boosted $H\rightarrow\bar{b}b$,
complementing the inclusive search for highly boosted $H\rightarrow\bar{b}b$
performed on 2016 data by CMS. The measurement of $Z\rightarrow\bar{b}b$ events
validates the application of these techniques at the trigger level
on a more frequent and better understood signature. This will lead to
a peer-reviewed publication. 
%Measurements of direct $H\rightarrow\bar{b}b$ decays
%may resolve the loop induced and tree-level contributions to the gluon fusion production mode
%and provide an alternative approach to study the top quark Yukawa coupling in addition to
%the $ttH$ process, while measuring $Z\rightarrow\bar{b}b$ validates the techniques for trigger analysis.
